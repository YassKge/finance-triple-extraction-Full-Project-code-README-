The Company has incurred losses since 2008 resulting from a combination of: declining net interest income, as our loan portfolio decreased from $109.8 million at December 31, 2008 to $62.3 million at December 31, 2016; increased provisions for loan losses between 2009 and 2012; and increasing non-interest expense related to professional fees and repossessed asset write-downs and costs. The Company recently incurred net losses of $866 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and $1,260 during the year ended December 31, 2016.  Our interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 has increased with the increase in the balance of our loan portfolio, however, this growth has also resulted in an increase to our provision for loan losses.  Our non-interest expense has also increased for compensation and occupancy cost and includes costs for problem asset resolution at the beginning of the year. The loss for 2016 was largely a result of our net interest income reflecting the low balance of our loan portfolio, increasing professional fees for problem asset resolution and additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Non-interest expense for 2016 was also impacted by an operational loss not reimbursable from our insurance.

From time to time, upon the customer’s written request, we recognize revenue when manufacturing is complete and the equipment is ready for shipment. At the customer’s request, we will bill the customer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The customer will formally request we ship the equipment per their direction from our manufacturing facility at a later specified date and that we segregate the equipment from our finished goods, such that they are not available to fill other orders. Per the customer’s agreement change of control is passed to the customer once the equipment is complete and ready for shipment. We have operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for many years, with consistent satisfactory results for both the customer and us. The credit terms on these agreements are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All control shouldered by the customer, and there are no exceptions to the customer’s commitment to accept and pay for the manufactured equipment. Revenues recognized at the completion of manufacturing for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $6.3 million.

The transfer of control occurs over this time period and, in management’s judgment, is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation.  The full transaction price allocated to flotetuzumab and the third DART molecule was recognized as revenue prior to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 as the option periods had ended. The development period for MGD007 was estimated to be 75 months, ending in December 2018, therefore the transaction price allocated to MGD007 is being recognized through that date.  Upon the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the pattern of revenue recognition for the upfront fee and the accounting for the milestones received in 2014 changed, but there was no material impact to revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Our lead product candidates are currently in clinical development. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2015.

Under this method, allocations were made to 406,970 and 374,862 of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 394,089 and 363,850 of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Since the Company expects to settle the principal amount of the outstanding Notes in cash, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. For the 2021 Notes, the conversion spread of 24.3 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $77.64 per share. For the 2024 Notes, the conversion spread of 20.1 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $57.14 per share.

Equipment revenues are derived from the sale of our cash access kiosks and related equipment and are accounted for under ASC 606, unless such transactions meet definition of a sales type or direct financing lease which are accounted for under ASC 842. Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods and services transfers to the customer generally upon shipment or delivery pursuant to the terms of the contract. The sales contracts are generally short-term in nature with payment terms ranging from 30 to 90 days, while certain agreements provide for extended payment terms of up to 60 months. Each contract containing extended payment terms over a period of 12 months is evaluated for the presence of a financing component. For those arrangements in which the financing component is determined to be significant to the contract, the transaction price is adjusted for the time value of money. Generally, our contracts with customers do not contain a financing component that has been determined to be significant to the contract. The cash access kiosk and related equipment sales contracts accounted for under ASC 842 were approximately $0.1 million and $2.7 million in aggregate revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. We did not have any cash access kiosk and related equipment sales transactions that qualified for sales type lease accounting treatment in 2018.

In general, it is Snap-on’s practice and intention to reinvest certain earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of 2019 year end, the company has not made a provision for incremental U.S. income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $271.8 million of such undistributed earnings that is deemed indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.  As a result of the Tax Act, which subjected the majority of the company’s undistributed foreign earnings to taxation for the 2017 tax year, the company can now repatriate non-U.S. cash in a tax efficient manner.  Accordingly, the company has reversed its prior assertion concerning the indefinite reinvestment of the majority of its undistributed foreign earnings and has recorded a deferred tax liability of $6.6 million for the incremental tax costs associated with the future potential repatriation of such earnings.

In January 2019, the Company reviewed the estimated useful lives of its rental equipment. This review indicated that the actual lives of its larger horsepower rental equipment were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the Company’s financial statements. These units incorporate newer technology and heavier, more robust castings and forging, which allows for complete overhauls at longer cycles when compared to its older, lower horsepower units.  Accordingly, as of January 1, 2019, the Company changed its estimates of the useful lives of for these higher horsepower units from 15 years to 20 years (for its 400-600 horsepower units) or 25 years (for its 1,380 horsepower units). This analysis is consistent with our peers, which are depreciating their compressor units over 20 to 30 years.  The effect of this change in estimate was to reduce 2019 depreciation expense by approximately $1.47 million, decrease 2019 net loss by $1.13 million, and decrease 2019 basic and diluted loss per share by $0.09.

Straight-line recognition is materially consistent with the pattern of performance of the research and development activities of each product candidate. The variable consideration related to the margetuximab performance obligation will be recognized upon certain regulatory achievements.

The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $2.2 million related to the Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements.

Equipment revenues are derived from the sale of our cash access and loyalty kiosks and related equipment and are accounted for under ASC 606, unless such transactions meet definition of a sales type or direct financing lease which are accounted for under ASC 842. Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods and services transfers to the customer generally upon shipment or delivery pursuant to the terms of the contract. The sales contracts are generally short-term in nature with payment terms ranging from 30 to 90 days, while certain agreements provide for extended payment terms of up to 60 months. Each contract containing extended payment terms over a period of 12 months is evaluated for the presence of a financing component; however, our contracts generally do not contain a financing component that has been determined to be significant to the contract. The cash access kiosk and related equipment sales contracts accounted for under ASC 842 were approximately $2.6 million in aggregate revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. We did not have any cash access kiosk and related equipment sales transactions that qualified for sales type lease accounting treatment in 2018 or 2017.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately $165.4 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries whose cumulative undistributed earnings total $765.5 million. The Tax Act imposed U.S. federal tax on all post-1986 foreign unrepatriated earnings accumulated through December 31, 2017. The portion of these earnings not subject to U.S. federal income tax as part of the one-time transition tax should, in general, not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The Company will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings, as well as future earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, to fund international growth and operations. If the Company were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, the Company would still be required to accrue and pay certain taxes upon repatriation, including foreign withholding taxes and certain U.S. state taxes and record foreign exchange rate impacts. Determination of the unrecorded deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is not practicable.

Reflects the retrospective adjustment related to the reverse stock split completed on August 1, 2019, and excludes unvested shares of common stock awarded under our Share Award Plans, which shares of common stock are considered participating securities because they participate equally in earnings and losses with all of our other shares of common stock.

Since the Company expects to settle the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes in cash, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. For the 2021 Notes, the conversion spread of 12.3 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $77.64 per share. For the 2024 Notes, the conversion spread of 20.1 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $57.14 per share.

Net income (loss) of foreign subsidiaries was $2.5 million, $2.0 million, and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Generally, it has been the Company's practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations.   As previously noted, the Tax Act made significant changes to the taxation of undistributed earnings, requiring that all previously untaxed earnings and profits of the Company's controlled foreign operations be subjected to the transition tax. Since these earnings have now been subjected to U.S. federal tax they would only be potentially subject to limited other taxes, including foreign withholding and certain state taxes. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for foreign withholdings and state taxes on its undistributed international earnings or losses of its foreign subsidiaries since it intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the United States.  The Company has estimated that the amount of the unrecorded deferred tax liability related to undistributed international earnings is approximately $1.1 million.

For the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019, the reported revenue and gross profit was approximately $464.0 million, and $34.6 million; respectively. This reflects the adoption of ASC 606 as revenue and gross profit would have been $10.3 million and $1.9 million less without ASC 606 adoption; respectively. This is primarily due to the change from 'point-in-time' to 'over-time' recognition as the standard requires. There was not a material tax impact for the twelve months ended June 29, 2019 from adopting ASC 606.

In accordance with its policy, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that the actual lives of certain manufacturing equipment at its manufacturing facilities were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The 2023 Notes will have no impact to diluted earnings per share ("EPS") until they meet the criteria for conversion, as discussed above, as we intend to settle the principal amount of the 2023 Notes in cash upon conversion. Under the treasury stock method, in periods when we report net income, we are required to include the effect of additional shares that may be issued under the 2023 Notes when the price of our Class A common stock exceeds the conversion price. Under this method, the cumulative dilutive effect of the 2023 Notes would be approximately 3.9 million shares if the average price of our Class A common stock was $73.46. However, upon conversion, there will be no economic dilution from the 2023 Notes, as exercise of the note hedges eliminate any dilution that would have otherwise occurred. The note hedges are required to be excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as they would be antidilutive under the treasury stock method.

Since our contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. In addition, changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. Changes in estimates favorably impacted operating income by approximately $7, $37, and $38 in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.

On November 21, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Milacron, which includes its existing information systems and internal controls over financial reporting.  In conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we have excluded Milacron from our evaluation as permitted under existing SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses.  We are currently in the process of evaluating and integrating Milacron’s historical internal control over financial reporting with ours.  The integration may lead to changes in future fiscal periods, but we do not expect these changes to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  We expect to complete this integration in fiscal 2021. For the year ended September 30, 2020, Milacron accounted for $735.8 of our total net revenue, and as of September 30, 2020, had total assets of $2,032.4 (inclusive of acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of $1,297.5).

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. We evaluate the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets and determine whether we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We perform this review for recoverability on a jurisdictional basis, whereby we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified.  Cumulative losses in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets.  Thus, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. We recorded net income for the years ended October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2018 and net loss for the year ended October 31, 2019.  We have recorded pre-tax cumulative income from operations of $40.1 million for the three-year period ended October 31, 2020.  We believe we will fully realize our deferred tax assets, net of a recorded valuation allowance. We project future taxable income using the same forecasts used to test long-lived assets and intangibles for impairment, scheduling out the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and reviewing our most recent financial operations. In the event the estimates and assumptions indicate we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, we record a valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets.

For fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rates on $41.6 million, $423.2 million and $155.2 million, respectively, of pre-tax loss from continuing operations were (10.9)%, 9.3% and 13.8%, respectively. The effective income tax rates for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were impacted by a lower income tax rate in many foreign jurisdictions in which our foreign subsidiaries operate, changes in valuation allowance, research and development tax credits, and a fair market value adjustment of warrant liability. For fiscal year 2020, the effective tax rate was also impacted by an adjustment in our Section 382 limitation which increased our

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 20, 2020. The Company early adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, which had a favorable impact of $0.4 million for the three months then ended.

The Fullstack Contingent Consideration will become issuable, subject to the terms and conditions of the Fullstack Merger Agreement. Of the total contingent 2,250,000 shares, (i) 1,250,000 are based upon final determination of the achievement of certain employee retention requirements and is being expensed over the retention period, (ii) 500,000 shares are based upon revenue performance in 2019 and 2020, earned on a sliding scale, in the event that the revenues for Fullstack are between $25.0 million and $35.0 million, and (iii) 500,000 shares are based upon contract performance milestones in 2019 and 2020, earned on a sliding scale, in the event that Fullstack obtains between 4 and 8 new university contracts. The fair value of the performance based Fullstack Contingent Consideration arrangements was estimated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation, based upon the result of forecast information. These measures are based upon significant inputs that are not observable by the market, and are therefore deemed to be Level 3 inputs. At each subsequent reporting date, the Company will remeasure the contingent consideration and recognize any changes in value, if necessary. If the probability of achieving the performance target significantly changes from what was initially anticipated, the change could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements in the period recognized.

For the three and six months ended March 28, 2020, the increase was driven by higher short-term variable cash incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower travel expenses.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company did not carry an income tax provision amount as the Company does not recognize tax benefits from current year tax losses in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of  $21.3 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  At March 31, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to amortization of the Notes.  The Company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as future realization of such assets is not more likely than not to occur.

Basic earnings per share is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (“WASO”) during the period. WASO excludes unvested shares of restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by diluted WASO. Diluted WASO includes the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities such as unvested shares of restricted stock using the treasury stock method, except where the effect of including potential common shares would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, 307 thousand and 503 thousand common stock equivalents were included in the diluted WASO, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 332 thousand and 3 thousand anti-dilutive common stock equivalents, respectively.

The Company recognized the $150.0 million allocated to the license when it satisfied its performance obligation and transferred the license to Incyte in 2017.  The $4.0 million allocated to the clinical activities was recognized over a period spanning 2017 and 2018.  No revenue was recognized under the Incyte License Agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.   

---

The Company also has an agreement with Incyte, which was entered into in 2018, under which the Company is to perform development and manufacturing services for Incyte’s clinical needs of retifanlimab (Incyte Clinical Supply Agreement).  The Company evaluated the agreement under ASC 606 and identified one performance obligation under the agreement: to perform services related to the development and manufacturing of the clinical supply of retifanlimab.  The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to develop and manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date.   During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $5.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, for services performed under the Incyte Clinical Supply Agreement.    

---

Due to the relatively short-term nature of the recognition period, the revenue associated with the MGD013 performance obligation was recognized on a straight-line basis as the Company performed research and development activities under the agreement. The fixed consideration related to the margetuximab performance obligation is also being recognized on a straight-line basis as the Company performs research and development activities under the agreement. Straight-line recognition is materially consistent with the pattern of performance of the research and development activities of each product candidate. The variable consideration related to the margetuximab performance obligation will be recognized upon certain regulatory achievements.  The Company recognized revenue of $3.6 million and $4.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the Zai Lab Agreement.  Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2020 reflected milestone revenue, whereas revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2019 was recognition of the deferred upfront payment.  At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $5.0 million of revenue was deferred under this agreement, all of which was current.  

---

The Company recognized revenue of $6.1 million when it satisfied its performance obligations under the agreements and transferred the MGD010 license and teplizumab assets to Provention in 2018.  The warrants were revalued at each reporting period based on the current Black-Scholes parameters until the warrants were exercised in July 2019. The resulting increase or decrease in the value of the warrants is reflected in Other income (expense) on the 2019 consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.  In July 2019, the Company exercised the warrants on a cashless basis, and subsequently sold all the shares of Provention common stock acquired through the exercise. No shares of Provention stock were held at December 31, 2019.

---

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Historically, the Company has funded its operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock.

The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2020 of $8.8 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $29.7 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2019 of $10.9 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $42.6 million. The income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes in our geographic pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, special items, certain equity related compensation and other discrete tax items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

We generated operating income of $61 million (margin of 5.4%) during the first quarter of 2020, as compared to $109 million (margin of 8.8%) in 2019.  Operating income in the first quarter of 2020 benefited from decreases in restructuring and realignment costs of $11 million and special charges of $4 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019.  Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating income was $70 million (adjusted margin of 6.2%) during the first quarter of 2020 as compared to $133 million (adjusted margin of 10.8%) in 2019. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable volume, impacted significantly by COVID-19, cost inflation, increased cost of quality, unfavorable mix and increased spending on strategic

The Notes will have no impact to diluted earnings per share ("EPS") until they meet the criteria for conversion, as discussed above, as we intend to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash upon conversion. Under the treasury stock method, in periods when we report net income, we are required to include the effect of additional shares that may be issued under the Notes when the price of our Class A common stock exceeds the conversion price. Under this method, the cumulative dilutive effect of the Notes would be approximately 3.9 million shares if the average price of our Class A common stock was $73.46. However, upon conversion, there will be no economic dilution from the Notes, as exercise of the note hedges eliminate any dilution that would have otherwise occurred. The note hedges are required to be excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as they would be antidilutive under the treasury stock method. 

---

For the three months ended April 3, 2020, the Company recognized income tax expense of $0.7 million on $1.1 million of pre-tax loss primarily due to losses in certain jurisdictions for which no benefit can be recorded due to full valuation allowance positions and overall pre-tax book loss.

For the six months ended April 3, 2020, the Company recognized income tax expense of $0.7 million on $2.3 million of pre-tax loss before tax primarily due to losses in certain jurisdictions for which no benefit can be recorded due to full valuation allowance positions and overall pre-tax book loss. For the six months ended March 29, 2019, the Company recognized income tax expense of $3.0 million on $11.9 million of pre-tax income.

Payments to customers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service are recorded as a reduction of revenues. Rebates to certain customers associated with payments for recycled or organic materials that are received and subsequently processed and sold to other third-parties amounted to $991 in the three months ended March 31, 2020 and $1,338 in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Rebates are generally recorded as a reduction of revenues upon the sale of such materials, or upon receipt of the recycled materials at our facilities. We did not record any revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.

In the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes (after application of an increase in the Company’s valuation allowance) on pre-tax loss of $53.2 million. In the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $1.3 million provision for income taxes (after application of a decrease in the Company’s valuation allowance) on pre-tax income of $54.0 million. The effective tax rates for the  three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, differ from the 21% federal statutory rate and applicable state statutory rates primarily due to the Company’s valuation allowance on its book losses and to the pre-tax portion of income and losses that are passed through to the other partners of the Operating Company and the San Francisco Venture. The Company’s tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2019 relates to adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance resulting from the limitation on post-2017 net operating losses to offset only 80% of deferred tax liabilities which was treated as a discrete event.

---

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, Altice USA recorded a tax benefit of $22,586 on pre-tax loss of $47,784, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate.  The higher tax rate was due to revaluation of state deferred taxes primarily due to certain changes to the state tax rates used to measure the Company’s deferred tax liabilities and certain non-deductible expenses.

---

With the decrease in U.S. Treasury and mortgage rates, MVB Mortgage saw a significant increase in originations during the first quarter 2020.  Mortgage originations increased above normal averages in the fourth quarter 2019 and remained strong with a significant rise in March 2020.  However, the Federal Reserve's stimulus, which included the purchase of $525 billion of Agency MBS, the primary vehicle used to hedge the locked pipeline, caused a decrease in the valuation of the MBS market. This volatility in valuation caused a decrease in the derivative asset of $3.6 million, which resulted in a net loss of $1.1 million at MVB Mortgage for the three months ended March 31, 2020. In addition, stress to the servicing market, caused by concerns around the length and commitment of deferral periods for residential mortgages, caused numerous servicing companies to pull back from the market which drove a reduction in premiums related to mortgage servicing rights. These reduced premiums also impacted the valuation of the derivative. 

---

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of $10.4 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $19.6 million. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 varied from the United States federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to base erosion and anti-abuse minimum tax ("BEAT"), foreign income inclusions such as GILTI, and a valuation allowance change on domestic deferred tax assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, no material discrete tax expense or benefit existed. 

---

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company recognized Income Tax Benefit of $5.4 million on Loss before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity of $25.3 million.

---

During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recognized Income Tax Expense of $21.0 million on Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income of Unconsolidated Entity of $98.9 million.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had net loss of $438,000 and $261,000, respectively. The Company does not anticipate forming any taxable REIT subsidiaries or otherwise generating future taxable income which may be offset by the net loss carry forward.  The Company considers that any deferred tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset which may be recorded in light of the net loss carry forward would be properly offset by an equal valuation allowance in that no future taxable income is expected.  Accordingly, no deferred tax benefit or deferred tax asset has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2020 was $19.0 million and our operating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 was $5.1 million. We have evaluated our current liquidity position in light of our history of declining revenue and operating losses as well as our near-term expectations of net negative cash flows from operating activities. While we currently believe existing unrestricted cash balances along with current availability on our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations for the next 12 months, our assessment is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Moreover, our operating forecast is partly dependent on factors that are outside of our control. Compounding these risks, uncertainties, and other factors are the potential effects of the recent coronavirus pandemic and related impacts on global commerce and financial markets. These conditions, when evaluated within the guidance of ASC 205-40, raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations over the 12 months from the date of this filing and, therefore, to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Since the Company expects to settle the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes in cash, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. For the 2021 Notes, the conversion spread of 12.3 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $77.64 per share.

— For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, Dell Technologies made certain reclassifications of net revenue between the products and services categories on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), which impacted previously reported amounts for the three and six months ended August 2, 2019.

The Fullstack Contingent Consideration are issuable, subject to the terms and conditions of the Fullstack Merger Agreement. Of the total contingent 2,250,000 shares, (i) 1,250,000 were based upon final determination of the achievement of certain employee retention requirements and was expensed over the retention period, (ii) 500,000 shares are based upon 2020 revenue performance, earned on a sliding scale, in the event that revenues for Fullstack are between $25.0 million and $35.0 million, and (iii) 500,000 shares are based on contract performance milestones in 2019 and 2020, earned on a sliding scale, in the event Fullstack obtains between 4 and 8 new university contracts. The retention-based shares were achieved and paid out as of April 1, 2020. The fair value of the remaining performance-based Fullstack Contingent Consideration arrangements was estimated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation, based on the result of forecast information. These measures are based on significant inputs that are not observable by the market, and are therefore deemed to be Level 3 inputs. At each subsequent reporting date, the Company will remeasure the contingent consideration and recognize any changes in value, if necessary. If the probability of achieving the performance target significantly changes from what was initially anticipated, the change could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements in the period recognized.

The Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Company incurred net losses of $32.9 million and used $62.0 million of cash and cash equivalents in operations. The Company expects to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative operating cash flows as it continues to develop its product candidates and prepares for potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix combination tablet and relugolix monotherapy tablet. In addition, the Company expects that its outstanding debt levels will increase in future periods, which will result in an increase in its quarterly interest payment obligations. The Company has not generated any product revenue to date and does not expect to generate product revenue unless and until it obtains regulatory approval for at least one of its product candidates. Based on its current operating plan, the Company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and its ability to borrow under the terms of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement (See Note 5(A)) will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of the Company’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. This estimate is based on the Company’s current assumptions, including assumptions relating to its ability to manage its spend, that might prove to be wrong, and it could use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects. Current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and amounts available under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement will not be sufficient to enable the Company to complete all necessary development and regulatory activities and commercially launch relugolix combination tablet or relugolix monotherapy tablet. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future.

Earnings per share (“EPS”) is presented for basic and diluted EPS. We compute basic EPS by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. However, as a result of our conservatorship status and the terms of the senior preferred stock, no amounts would be available to distribute as dividends to common or preferred stockholders (other than to Treasury as the holder of the senior preferred stock). Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders excludes amounts attributable to the senior preferred stock. Weighted average common shares include 4.7 billion and 4.6 billion shares for the periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that would be issued upon the full exercise of the warrant issued to Treasury from the date the warrant was issued through June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most state income tax purposes, with each partner being separately taxed on their share of our taxable income. We have elected to classify one of our subsidiaries, USD Rail LP, as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes due to treasury regulations that do not permit the income of this subsidiary to be classified as “qualifying income” as such term is defined in §7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We are also subject to state franchise tax in the state of Texas, which is treated as an income tax under the applicable accounting guidance.

For the 2021 Notes, the conversion spread of 12.3 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $77.64 per share. For the 2024 Notes, the conversion spread of 20.1 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $57.14 per share. For the 2025 Notes, the conversion spread of 24.1 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company's common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $41.50 per share.

The diluted weighted average number of common units is computed based on the weighted average number of common units plus the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period, which include (i) our Series A preferred units and (ii) our equity-indexed compensation plan awards. When applying the if-converted method prescribed by FASB guidance, the possible conversion of approximately 71 million Series A preferred units, on a weighted-average basis, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income/(loss) per common unit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as the effect was antidilutive for each period. Our equity-indexed compensation plan awards that contemplate the issuance of common units are considered dilutive unless (i) they become vested only upon the satisfaction of a performance condition and (ii) that performance condition has yet to be satisfied. Equity-indexed compensation plan awards that were deemed to be dilutive during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were reduced by a hypothetical common unit repurchase based on the remaining unamortized fair value, as prescribed by the treasury stock method in guidance issued by the FASB. For the three months ended June 30, 2020, such LTIP awards were dilutive; however, the approximately 0.1 million dilutive LTIP awards, on a weighted-average basis, did not change the presentation of diluted weighted average common units outstanding or diluted net income per common unit. Potentially dilutive LTIP awards of approximately 0.5 million, on a weighted-average basis, were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common unit for the six months ended June 30, 2020 as the effect was antidilutive. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our equity-indexed compensation plan awards.

As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $55.5 million and its accumulated deficit was $767.2 million.

The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to develop and manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date.  During the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $1.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively, for services performed under the Incyte Clinical Supply Agreement.  During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $7.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, for services performed under the Incyte Clinical Supply Agreement.

During 2019, the Company entered into two agreements under which the Company is to perform manufacturing services for Zai Lab’s clinical needs of margetuximab and MGD013 (Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements).  The Company evaluated the agreements under ASC 606 and determined that they should be accounted for as a single contract and identified two performance obligations within that contract: to perform services related to manufacturing the clinical supply of each of margetuximab and MGD013.  The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $0.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements.  No such revenue was recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.

The resulting increase or decrease in the value of the warrants is reflected in Other income (expense) on the 2019 consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.  In July 2019, the Company exercised the warrants on a cashless basis, and subsequently sold all the shares of Provention common stock acquired through the exercise. No shares of Provention stock were held at December 31, 2019.

The Company has issued shares of purchased restricted common stock and purchased restricted common stock units (collectively “PRSUs”) which contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends while these shares are outstanding and thus are considered participating securities. Such securities are required to be included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The Company did not present the two-class method since the difference between basic and diluted net income per share for both unrestricted common shareholders and PRSU shareholders was less than $0.01 per share for each period presented, and the number of PRSUs outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 was immaterial. Net income allocated to such PRSUs was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and $0.3 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

For the six months ended July 31, 2020, the benefit for income taxes from continuing operations was approximately $188,000 on a pre-tax net loss from continuing operations of $8.5 million. For the six months ended July 31, 2019, the benefit for income taxes from continuing operations was approximately $44,000 on a pre-tax net loss of $3.7 million. The variance between our actual provision and the expected provision based on the U.S. statutory rate is due primarily to recording valuation allowances against the increase in our deferred tax assets in the respective periods, plus the effect of foreign withholding taxes.

---

---

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company did not carry an income tax provision amount as the Company does not recognize tax benefits from current year tax losses in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  The Company’s tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $40.5 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  At June 30, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to amortization of the Notes.  The Company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as future realization of such assets is not more likely than not to occur.

In the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded a $1.3 million provision for income taxes (after application of a decrease in the Company’s valuation allowance) on pre-tax income of $31.4 million. The effective tax rates for the  six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, differ from the 21% federal statutory rate and applicable state statutory rates primarily due to the Company’s valuation allowance on its book losses, disallowance of executive compensation expenses not deductible for tax, and to the pre-tax portion of income and losses that are passed through to the other partners of the Operating Company and the San Francisco Venture. The Company’s tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2019 relates to adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance resulting from the limitation on post-2017 net operating losses to offset only 80% of deferred tax liabilities which was treated as a discrete event.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at June 30, 2020 and 2019, is considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant. 

---

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Since inception, the Company has incurred recurring losses including net losses of $140.0 million and $192.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.

The income tax benefit for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2020 was calculated using a discrete approach.

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company earned $199.8 million from the Spanish Electricity System of which $171.9 million were billing through the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (“CNMC”). These operating revenues were earned within the Regulated Solar and Wind segment and represented 38% of the Company’s net consolidated operating revenues. The CNMC is the state-owned regulator of the Spanish Electricity System who collects the funds payable, mainly from the tariffs to end user customers, and is responsible for the calculation and the settlement of regulated payments. The Company’s management believes that this concentration of risk is mitigated by, among other things, the indirect support of the Spanish government for the CNMC’s obligations and, in general, by the regulated rate system in Spain.

The Company operates in four reportable operating segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness. The Company’s operating segments of rental operations and real estate development are no longer disclosed as separate reportable operating segments and are included in the “Corporate and Other” category in the tables below as they do not meet the quantitative threshold and from a qualitative perspective are not a core focus of the Company's main agribusiness activities. Prior years’ information has been restated to conform to the current year’s presentation. The reportable operating segments of the Company are strategic business units with different products and services, distribution processes and customer bases. The fresh lemons segment includes sales, farming and harvesting expenses and third-party grower costs relative to fresh lemons. The lemon packing segment includes packing revenues and shipping and handling revenues relative to lemon packing. The lemon packing segment expenses are comprised of lemon packing costs. The lemon packing segment revenues include intersegment revenues between fresh lemons and lemon packing. The intersegment revenues are included gross in the segment note and a separate line item is shown as an elimination. The avocados segment includes sales, farming and harvest costs. The other agribusiness segment includes sales, farming and harvest costs of oranges, specialty citrus and other crops. Revenues related to rental operations are included in “Corporate and Other.” Other agribusiness revenues for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2020, consists of oranges of $2,232,000 and $7,171,000, respectively, and specialty citrus and other crops of $788,000 and $3,832,000, respectively.

The Company's top ten customers accounted for approximately 59% and 56% of net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, and approximately 56% and 54%, respectively, in the corresponding periods of the previous year. A significant portion of these revenues are attributable to sales of the Company’s products to distributors of electronic components.

We exclude common shares subject to a holdback pursuant to business combinations from the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding where the release of such shares is contingent upon an event not solely subject to the passage of time. As of June 30, 2020, there were approximately 6,000 contingently returnable shares related to our acquisition of BluTrend which were excluded from the computation of basic net income per share as these shares are subject to sellers’ indemnification obligations and are subject to a holdback. There were approximately 163,000 contingently returnable shares as of June 30, 2019 related to our acquisitions of ClickPay and BluTrend. Dilutive common shares outstanding include the weighted average contingently returnable shares discussed above that are subject to a holdback, and any contingently returnable shares prior to their release during each period. These shares are subject to releases to the sellers on the second anniversary dates of the acquisitions which are contingent on the sellers’ indemnification obligations.

In April 2017, the FCA announced an investigation relating to suspected competition law breaches in the aviation and aerospace broking industry, which, for Aon in 2016, represented less than $100 million in global revenue. The European Commission has now assumed jurisdiction over the investigation in place of the FCA. Other antitrust agencies outside the European Union are also conducting formal or informal investigations regarding these matters. Aon intends to work diligently with all antitrust agencies concerned to ensure they can carry out their work as efficiently as possible. At this time, in light of the uncertainties and many variables involved, Aon cannot estimate the ultimate impact on the Company from these investigations or any related private litigation, nor any damages, penalties, or fines related to them. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded income tax expense of $45 million in continuing operations on pre-tax income of $214 million compared to income tax expense of $33 million on pre-tax income of $152 million during the three months ended June 30, 2019. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $30 million in continuing operations on pre-tax income of $299 million compared to income tax expense of $53 million on pre-tax income of $236 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, we utilized the discrete effective tax rate method, as allowed by the FASB ASC 740-270-30-18, “Income Taxes–Interim Reporting,” to calculate the interim income tax provision. The discrete method is applied when application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year-to-date period as if it were the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. We believe that, at this time, the use of this discrete method is more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method as the estimated annual effective tax rate method is not reliable due to the high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pre-tax income due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the provision for income taxes was calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. In calculating “ordinary” income, non-taxable income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was deducted from pre-tax income or loss in the determination of the annualized effective tax rate used to calculate income taxes for the quarter. The reconciliation between the amount of recorded income tax expense and the amount calculated at the statutory federal tax rate is shown in the following table:

The actuarial losses associated with the pension obligations recorded in prior years in accumulated other comprehensive income exceeding 10% of the defined benefit obligation are recorded ratably over the current year through profit and loss separately from income from operations and amounted to $5.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020.

---

The amounts recorded in prior years in AOCI exceeding 10% of the defined benefit obligation are recorded ratably as reclassification of actuarial losses over the current year through profit and loss separately from income from operations and amounted to $5.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020.

We also excluded 8,950 unvested stock awards granted to certain employees from the computation of diluted weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding because they are subject to certain performance-based annual vesting conditions which had not been achieved by August 1, 2020. Assuming the performance-criteria had been achieved as of August 1, 2020, the incremental dilutive impact would have been 6,785 shares.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of June 30, 2020 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared under U.S. GAAP. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development and clinical manufacturing of its and its collaborators' product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $99,352 and, as of June 30, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $1,752,221. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development, reduce uses of cash for operating and investing activities for non-healthcare businesses, obtain regulatory approval of its products, successfully commercialize its products, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct the recognition of revenue on a construction contract, which was the result of an overstatement of operating revenue and receivables of $7.7 million and an understatement of operating expense and accounts payable of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This adjustment resulted in an after-tax reduction to net income of $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. The Company evaluated the impact of the out-of-period adjustment and concluded it was not material to any previously issued interim and annual consolidated financial statements and the adjustment was not material to the three months ended March 31, 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2020 was $19.7 million and our operating loss for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020 was $4.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively. We have evaluated our current liquidity position in light of our history of declining revenue and operating losses as well as our near-term expectations of net negative cash flows from operating activities. While we currently believe existing unrestricted cash balances along with current availability on our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations for the next 12 months, our assessment is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Moreover, our operating forecast is partly dependent on factors that are outside of our control. Compounding these risks, uncertainties, and other factors are the potential effects of the recent coronavirus pandemic and related impacts on global commerce and financial markets. These conditions, when evaluated within the guidance of ASC 205-40, raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations over the 12 months from the date of this filing and, therefore, to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Albemarle Corporation and our wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, “Albemarle,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “the Company”) contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement, in all material respects, of our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

---

Loss from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders was $1.3 million for the second quarter compared to income from continuing operations attributable to GCP shareholders of $3.1 million for the prior-year quarter. The change was primarily due to lower gross profit compared to the prior-year quarter due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by reduced restructuring and repositioning costs, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and lower income tax expense. 

---

All outstanding stock awards were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share in the three-month and six month fiscal periods ended July 3, 2020 because their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations. For the three-month and six-month fiscal periods ended July 3, 2020, respectively, an additional 5,226 and 43,645 shares issuable under equity awards, which would have been dilutive if exercised based on the average market price being higher than the exercise price, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations.

Pre-tax earnings improved from pre-tax income of $14.1 million in 2018 to pre-tax income of $38.4 million in 2019, a 172% improvement from prior year. The primary driver for the increase in operating income was related to the Company's continued margin expansion and lower interest expense.

We have operating leases with tenants that expire at various dates through 2040. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $21,519,000 and $19,253,000 of real estate revenue, respectively, related to operating lease payments, of which $4,592,000 and $3,718,000, respectively, was for variable lease payments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $64,824,000 and $53,280,000 of real estate revenue, respectively, related to operating lease payments, of which $13,861,000 and $10,426,000, respectively, was for variable lease payments.

---

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $4,000 and $7,000, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and $15,000 and $18,000, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were 45,000 and 43,500 nonvested shares, respectively, of our restricted common stock outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were 208 redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership outstanding, but such units were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods.

As of September 30, 2020, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $63.2 million and its accumulated deficit was $777.2 million. For the six months ended September 30, 2020 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Company incurred net losses of $18.6 million and $72.6 million, respectively. The Company expects to continue to incur significant operating and net losses, as well as negative cash flows from operations, for the foreseeable future as it continues to develop its gene therapy product candidates and prepares for potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of its products, if approved. The Company has not generated any revenue to date and does not expect to generate product revenue unless and until it successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval for at least one of its product candidates, and its current cash and cash equivalents balance will not be sufficient to complete all necessary development activities and commercially launch its products. The Company anticipates that its current cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to sustain operations into the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $197 million in continuing operations on a pre-tax loss of $304 million compared to income tax expense of $22 million on a pre-tax loss of $125 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $227 million in continuing operations on a pre-tax loss of $5 million compared to income tax expense of $75 million on pre-tax income of $111 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we utilized the discrete effective tax rate method, as allowed by the FASB ASC 740-270-30-18, “Income Taxes–Interim Reporting,” to calculate the interim income tax provision. The discrete method is applied when application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year-to-date period as if it were the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. We believe that, at this time, the use of this discrete method is more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method as the estimated annual effective tax rate method is not reliable due to the high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pre-tax income due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving guidance by the government on utilization of grant funds. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the provision for income taxes was calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. In calculating “ordinary” income, non‑taxable income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was deducted from pre-tax income or loss in the determination of the annualized effective tax rate used to calculate income taxes for the quarter. The reconciliation between the amount of recorded income tax expense and the amount calculated at the statutory federal tax rate is shown in the following table:

---

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted a new economic scenario generator to calculate the fair value of the GMIB reinsurance contract asset and GMxB derivative features liability, eliminating reliance on AXA Group for scenario production. The new economic scenario generator allows for a tighter calibration of U.S. indices, better reflecting the Company’s actual portfolio. The net impact of the new economic scenario generator resulted in an increase in Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes of $165 million, and an increase to Net Income (loss) of $130 million during the first nine months of 2020.

On May 29, 2020, the Bank purchased the first floor of its corporate headquarters building, which is currently occupied by multiple tenants. The Bank assumed the existing leases, all of which are operating leases. The Bank, as lessor, recognized rental income of $87,000 and $117,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

---

Revenue associated with power and connectivity included within storage rental revenue was $12,033 and $34,986 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and $12,001 and $31,031 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.

---

For the nine months ended October 31, 2020, the benefit for income taxes from continuing operations was approximately $79,000 on a pre-tax net loss from continuing operations of $10.8 million. For the nine months ended October 31, 2019, the benefit for income taxes from continuing operations was approximately $75,000 on a pre-tax net loss of $5.1 million. The variance between our actual provision and the expected provision based on the U.S. statutory rate is due primarily to recording valuation allowances against the increase in our deferred tax assets in the respective periods, plus the effect of foreign withholding taxes.

---

The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects (including travel advisories, shutdowns or shelter-in-place mandates or recommendations, restrictive protocols, and canceled events) have caused a significant decline in the demand for air travel and, as a result, the Company has experienced a significant deterioration in its revenues during the nine months ended October 1, 2020, resulting in a net loss of $574.4 for that period. The length of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the aviation industry and the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. The Company expects the pandemic and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on its business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be for an extended period of time. 

---

---

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, weighted average shares used for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share are the same, as the inclusion of 1.2 shares, 0.9 shares, 1.3 shares, and 0.4 shares for warrants, RSU awards, PSU awards, and stock options, respectively, would be antidilutive to the earnings per share calculation due to the net loss from continuing operations available to common shareholders in the period.

— For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, Dell Technologies made certain reclassifications of net revenue between the products and services categories on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), which impacted previously reported amounts for the three and nine months ended November 1, 2019.

Prior period results were recast to conform with these changes, and resulted in an increase to services revenue and an equal and offsetting decrease to product revenue of $210 million and $584 million for the three and nine months ended November 1, 2019, respectively.  Total net revenue as previously reported remains unchanged.  The Company did not recast cost of goods sold for the related revenue reclassifications due to immateriality.

In April 2017, the FCA announced an investigation relating to suspected competition law breaches in the aviation and aerospace broking industry, which, for Aon in 2016, represented less than $100 million in global revenue. The European Commission has now assumed jurisdiction over the investigation in place of the FCA. Other antitrust agencies outside the European Union are also conducting formal or informal investigations regarding these matters.

Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2020 was $13.2 million. Our operating losses for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $2.9 million and $10.5 million, respectively. We have evaluated our current liquidity position in light of our history of declining revenue and operating losses as well as our near-term expectations of net negative cash flows from operating activities. While we currently believe existing unrestricted cash balances along with current availability on our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations for the next 12 months, our assessment is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Moreover, our operating forecast is partly dependent on factors that are outside of our control. Compounding these risks, uncertainties, and other factors are the potential effects of the recent coronavirus pandemic and related impacts on global commerce and financial markets. These conditions, when evaluated within the guidance of ASC 205-40, raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations over the 12 months from the date of this filing and, therefore, to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2020 was $13.2 million, $8.4 million of which was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and our operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $10.5 million . As further discussed in Part II, Item 8, “Note 1—Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K, due to our history of declining revenue and operating losses, as well as our near-term expectations of net negative cash flows from operating activities, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and severe impacts to global financial markets, management has concluded that substantial doubt is deemed to exist about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to improve cash flow by implementing some combination of the following: reduce operating expenses; improve working capital; defer certain obligations where we believe we have the legal basis to do so; draw upon our line of credit; sell businesses, product lines or assets; effectuate strategic alliances; efficiently repatriate cash; or obtain outside investment. Our limited cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price, inhibit our ability to obtain outside investment or strategic alliances.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, as applicable, were based on 4.9 million and 4.5 million of such awards, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, as applicable, were based on 5.0 million and 4.6 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

The 2023 Notes will have no impact on diluted earnings per share ("EPS") until they meet the criteria for conversion, as discussed above, as we intend to settle the principal amount of the 2023 Notes in cash upon conversion. Under the treasury stock method, in periods when we report net income, we are required to include the effect of additional shares that may be issued under the 2023 Notes when the price of our Class A common stock exceeds the conversion price. Under this method, the cumulative dilutive effect of the 2023 Notes would be approximately 3.9 million shares if the average price of our Class A common stock was $73.46. However, upon conversion, there will be no economic dilution from the 2023 Notes, as exercise of the note hedges eliminate any dilution that would have otherwise occurred. The note hedges are required to be excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as they would be antidilutive under the treasury stock method.

As of each of October 30, 2020 and January 31, 2020, the Company had $4.6 million of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards for state tax returns that are not included with those of other Dell entities. These net operating loss carryforwards began expiring in the fiscal year ended February 1, 2019. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these net operating loss carryforwards, the Company has provided valuation allowances for the full amount as of October 30, 2020 and January 31, 2020. Because the Company is included in the tax filings of other Dell entities, management has determined that it will be able to realize the remainder of its deferred tax assets. If the Company's tax provision had been prepared using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma pre-tax loss, tax benefit and net loss for the nine months ended October 30, 2020 would have been $17.7 million, $3.7 million and $14.0 million, respectively, as a result of the recognition of a valuation allowance that would have been recorded on a significant amount of deferred tax assets as well as certain attributes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that would be lost if not utilized by the Dell consolidated group.

Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

During the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of $12 million and $19 million, respectively, which reflects income tax expense in countries where the Company is profitable; accrued withholding taxes; ongoing assessments related to the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits; the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and/or recognize expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions (including the U.S.) due to valuation allowances; and other non-recurring tax items, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances.  Pretax losses from continuing operations in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $106 million and $46 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate in those years.

---

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, Kennedy Wilson generated pretax book loss of $75.0 million related to its global operations and recorded a tax benefit of $10.3 million. The tax benefit for the period is below the US statutory tax rate, primarily as a result of non-deductible executive compensation, and increases in the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets.  The net increase in the valuation allowance pertains to United Kingdom (“UK”) interest deduction carryovers and certain foreign net operating losses, partially offset by decreases in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with the Company’s tax basis in excess of its book carrying value for its investment in the KWE partnership.

We have operating leases with tenants that expire at various dates through 2050. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $29,004,000 and $26,668,000, respectively, of revenues related to operating lease payments, of which $5,233,000 and $4,649,000, respectively, was for variable lease payments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $86,626,000 and $88,619,000, respectively, of revenues related to operating lease payments, of which $14,125,000 and $13,739,000, respectively, was for variable lease payments. As of September 30, 2020, the following table sets forth the undiscounted cash flows for future minimum base rents due under operating leases for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and for each of the next four years ending December 31 and thereafter for properties that we wholly own:

---

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $0 and $7,000, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and $9,000 and $21,000, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.

---

The RSUs and PSUs are not a participating security as the dividends are forfeitable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 no incremental RSUs or PSUs were included in the diluted EPS calculation as their effect was anti-dilutive under the “if converted” method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 we included 69,000 and 145,000 incremental RSUs in the diluted EPS calculation and no incremental PSUs were included in the EPS calculation due to their contingent nature.

---

For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company included 297,927 and 196,216 RSUs respectively, that have vested but have not been settled in Class A Shares in the weighted-average Class A Shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per Class A Share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company included 473,070 and 181,793 RSUs respectively, that have vested but have not been settled in Class A Shares in the weighted-average Class A Shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted earnings (loss) per Class A Share.

As of September 30, 2020, there were 281,588 restricted stock unit awards for which the service-based vesting conditions for these awards were not met as of the measurement date. As such, these awards were excluded from basic earnings per share. These awards had a 80,845 and 42,314 share impact on dilutive weighted average shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.  As of September 30, 2020, there were 447,295 restricted stock unit awards for which the performance-based and market-based vesting conditions were not met as of the measurement date and, as such, these awards were excluded from basic and diluted earnings per share. Based on the Company's closing share price on September 30, 

---

2020, there were 87,822 restricted stock unit awards classified as a liability. The Company considered the impact on diluted earnings as if the award was settled in cash or in shares. These awards had a 44,252 and 35,492 share impact on dilutive weighted average shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

---

As of September 30, 2020, there were 52,221 restricted stock unit awards granted under the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Equity Plan") to certain directors and employees, for which the service-based vesting conditions for these awards were not met as of the measurement date. As such, these awards were excluded from basic earnings per share. These awards had a 41,640 and 35,662 share impact on dilutive weighted average shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

---

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted a new economic scenario generator to calculate the fair value of the GMIB reinsurance contract asset and GMxB derivative features liability, eliminating reliance on AXA Group for scenario production. The new economic scenario generator allows for a tighter calibration of U.S. indices, better reflecting the Company’s actual portfolio. The net impact of the new economic scenario generator resulted in an increase in Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes of $201 million, and an increase to Net Income (loss) of $159 million during the first nine months of 2020.

---

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, diluted average common shares outstanding equaled average common shares outstanding because our securities convertible into common shares had an anti-dilutive effect. Weighted average restricted share rights outstanding were 53.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Farms located in California, Florida, and Arizona accounted for approximately $22.2 million (52.9%), $10.0 million (23.9%) and $4.3 million (10.2%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster (such as an earthquake, wildfire, or flood) occur or climactic change impact the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  None of our farms in California or Florida have been materially impacted by the recent wildfires or hurricanes that occurred in those respective regions.  No other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of our total lease revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

The Company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the net loss was $59,203, compared to net loss of $11,962 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The difference year over year is primarily attributable to $39,965 in deferred revenue that was recognized in the first quarter of 2019 as a result of the discontinuation of the partnership with Takeda in that quarter. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $251,575. The future success of the Company is dependent on, among other factors, its ability to identify and develop its product candidates and ultimately upon its ability to attain profitable operations. The Company has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expense to support such research and development. Net losses and negative operating cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders' equity and working capital.

We leased two travel centers to franchisees as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. These two lease agreements expire in June 2022. These leases include rent escalations that are contingent on future events, namely inflation or our investing in capital improvements at these travel centers. Rent revenues from these operating leases totaled $584 and $572 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $1,728 and $1,722 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Future minimum lease payments due to us for the two leased sites under these operating leases as of September 30, 2020, were $584 for the remainder of 2020, $2,336 for the year 2021 and $1,168 for the year 2022. See above for information regarding certain travel centers that we leased from SVC in which we sublease a portion of the travel centers to third parties to operate other retail operations.

The Company has issued shares of purchased restricted common stock and purchased restricted common stock units (collectively “PRSUs”) which contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends while these shares are outstanding and thus are considered participating securities. Such securities are required to be included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The Company did not present the two-class method since the difference between basic and diluted net income per share for both unrestricted common shareholders and PRSU shareholders was less than $0.01 per share for each period presented, except for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 where the difference was less than $0.03 per share, and the number of PRSUs outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 was immaterial. Net income allocated to such PRSUs was $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $0.5 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

---

We include unvested shares of restricted stock in the computation of diluted EPS by using the more dilutive of the two-class method or treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, there were 2,551 and zero dilutive participating securities, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no dilutive participating securities.

---

The following tables summarize our segment information. Intersegment revenues were immaterial for all segments, with the exception of Other, which includes revenues from insurance premiums charged to other segments for workers’ compensation, auto, and other types of insurance. Intersegment revenues included in Other revenues below were $11.9 million and $20.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $59.1 million and $66.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

---

There are no convertible securities which would affect the numerator in calculating basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share; therefore, net (loss) income as presented on the Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income is used as the numerator.

---

For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had net loss of $740,000 and $340,000, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,759,000 and $848,000, respectively. The Company formed a taxable REIT subsidiary which may generate future taxable income which may offset by the net loss carry forward. The Company considers that any deferred tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset which may be recorded in light of the net loss carry forward would be properly offset by an equal valuation allowance.  Accordingly, no deferred tax benefit or deferred tax asset has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

SPS’ net income was approximately $241.5 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020 compared with approximately $218.0 million for the prior year.

Earnings per share (“EPS”) is presented for basic and diluted EPS. We compute basic EPS by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. However, as a result of our conservatorship status and the terms of the senior preferred stock, no amounts would be available to distribute as dividends to common or preferred stockholders (other than to Treasury as the holder of the senior preferred stock). Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders excludes amounts attributable to the senior preferred stock. Weighted average common shares include 4.7 billion and 4.6 billion shares for the periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that would be issued upon the full exercise of the warrant issued to Treasury from the date the warrant was issued through September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

---

Although basic earnings per share only considers shares of common stock outstanding during the period, the calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the following adjustments to weighted average common shares related to stock-based compensation plans: third quarter 2020 and 2019 — 0.3 million and 1.1 million; first nine months of 2020 and 2019 — 0.5 million and 1.2 million, respectively.

---

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company did not carry an income tax provision amount as the Company does not recognize tax benefits from current year tax losses in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  The Company’s tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $59.3 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  At September 30, 2020, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to amortization of the Notes.  The Company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as future realization of such assets is not more likely than not to occur.

---

Each lease for the seven Transitional Properties was amended by the parties. The Company agreed to reduce the aggregate annual fixed rent on the Transitional Properties by approximately $6.2 million to approximately $8.1 million (including approximately $1.2 million of ground rent and the repayment of deferral amounts for the months of April, May and June, 2020). The Company agreed to the deferral of all fixed rent due under the Transitional Leases for the months of April, May and June 2020. This total amount deferred under each Transitional Lease is included in the calculation of the fixed rent under the Transitional Lease and amortized over the remaining current term of the Transitional Lease. The Transitional Leases have expiration dates occurring between November 2026 and March 2029.

From time to time, upon the customer’s written request, we recognize revenue when manufacturing is complete and the equipment is ready for shipment. At the customer’s request, we will bill the customer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The customer will formally request that we ship the equipment per their direction from our manufacturing facility at a later specified date and that we segregate the equipment from our finished goods, such that they are not available to fill other orders. Per the customer’s agreement change of control is passed to the customer once the equipment is complete and ready for shipment. We have operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for many years, with consistent and satisfactory results for both the customer and us. The credit terms on these agreements are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All control is shouldered by the customer and there are no exceptions to the customer’s commitment to accept and pay for the manufactured equipment. Revenue recognized related to bill and hold arrangements for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $852,000 and $9.4 million, respectively.

---

The Company's top ten customers accounted for approximately 65% and 56% of net revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and approximately 55% and 54%, respectively, in the corresponding periods of the previous year. A significant portion of these revenues are attributable to sales of the Company’s products to distributors of electronic components. These distributors sell the Company’s products to a broad, diverse range of end users, including original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and merchant power supply manufacturers. Sales to distributors were $85.3 million and $256.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and $78.0 million and $222.7 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2019. Direct sales to OEMs and power-supply manufacturers accounted for the remainder.

---

Dilutive effect of common stock equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was 1,604 shares; however, this amount was not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the impact would have been anti-dilutive.

Revenue from this grant was based upon internal costs incurred by the Company that were specifically covered by the grant as well as certain specified overhead expenses. Revenue was recognized when the Company incurred these covered expenses related to the grant’s continued progression. The Company submitted invoices to Boston University for only those expenses which had been incurred by the Company in each period, resulting in reimbursement in arrears. Prior to discontinuation of the work on this grant, $4.0 million in revenue was recognized, all of which has been received in cash from Boston University.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of September 30, 2020 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared under U.S. GAAP. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development, and clinical manufacturing of its and its collaborators' product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $128,860 and, as of September 30, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $1,781,729. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development, reduce uses of cash for operating and investing activities for non-healthcare businesses, obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, successfully commercialize its product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct the recognition of revenue on a construction contract, which was the result of an overstatement of operating revenue and receivables of $7.7 million and an understatement of operating expense and accounts payable of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This adjustment resulted in an after-tax reduction to net income of $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. The Company evaluated the impact of the out-of-period adjustment and concluded it was not material to any previously issued interim and annual consolidated financial statements and the adjustment was not material to the three months ended March 31, 2020 or the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

The Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. During the six months ended September 30, 2020, the Company incurred net losses of $99.9 million and used $110.6 million of cash and cash equivalents in operations. The Company expects to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative operating cash flows as it continues to develop its product candidates and prepares for potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of relugolix combination tablet and relugolix monotherapy tablet. In addition, the Company currently expects that its outstanding debt levels will increase in future periods, which will result in an increase in its quarterly interest payment obligations. The Company has not generated any product revenue to date and does not expect to generate product revenue unless and until it obtains regulatory approval for at least one of its product candidates. Based on its current operating plan, the Company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and its ability to borrow under the terms of the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Loan Agreement (See Note 5) will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requir

For the three month period ended September 30, 2020, Sirius Group reported an income tax expense (benefit) of $23.5 million on pre-tax income (loss) of $(80.5) million. The difference between the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and the Swedish statutory tax rate of 21.4% (the rate at which the majority of Sirius Group's worldwide operations are taxed) is primarily attributable to unrealized investment gains in specific U.S. entities and adjustments required under applicable GAAP guidance, which are based on the annual estimated effective tax rate.  For the nine month period ended September 30, 2020, Sirius Group reported an income tax expense (benefit) of $19.9 million on pre-tax income (loss) of $(212.6) million. The difference between the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and the Swedish statutory rate of 21.4% was primarily attributable to valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets, unrealized investment gains in specific U.S. entities, and adjustments required under applicable GAAP guidance, which are based on the annual estimated effective tax rate.

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2019, Sirius Group reported an income tax expense of $15.6 million on pre-tax income of $120.3 million. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was lower than the Swedish statutory rate of 21.4% primarily because of income recognized in countries with lower rates than Sweden and adjustments required under applicable GAAP guidance, which are based on the annual estimated effective tax rate.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, APS voluntarily suspended disconnections of customers for nonpayment beginning March 13, 2020.  In addition, APS waived all late payment fees during this current suspension period.  On September 14, 2020, APS extended this suspension of disconnection of customers for nonpayment and waiver of late payment fees until December 31, 2020.  APS currently estimates that the Summer Disconnection Moratorium (see below for discussion of the Summer Disconnection Moratorium), the suspension of disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased bad debt expense associated with both events will result in a negative impact to its 2020 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pre-tax above the impact of disconnections on its operating results for years that did not have the Summer Disconnection Moratorium or COVID-19 pandemic.  APS is experiencing an increase in bad debt expense associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but it still believes that costs associated with the Summer Disconnection Moratorium and the COVID-19 disconnection suspensions and related bad debt expense with both events will fall within this estimated $20 million to $30 million range.  These estimated impact amounts depend on certain current assumptions, including, but not limited to, customer behaviors, population and employment growth, and the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy.  Additionally, due to COVID-19, APS delayed the reset of the Environmental Improvement Surcharge ("EIS") adjustor and suspended the discontinuation of TEAM Phase II to the first billing cycle in May 2020 rather than April 2020 (see below for discussion of EIS and TEAM Phase II).

APS currently estimates that the Summer Disconnection Moratorium, the suspension of disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increased bad debt expense associated with both events will result in a negative impact to its 2020 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pre-tax above the impact of disconnections on its operating results for years that did not have the Summer Disconnection Moratorium or COVID-19 pandemic.  These estimated impact amounts depend on certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, customer behaviors, population and employment growth, the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and the results of final rulemaking related to the Summer Disconnection Moratorium.  See "COVID-19 Pandemic" above for more information.

The Company's leases typically have escalators that are either based on a stated percentage or an index such as CPI (consumer price index). In addition, most of the Company's leases include nonlease components, such as reimbursement of operating expenses as additional rent, or include the reimbursement of expected operating expenses as part of the lease payment. The Company adopted an accounting policy to combine lease and nonlease components. Rent escalators based on indices and reimbursements of operating expenses that are not included in the lease rate are considered variable lease payments. Variable payments are recognized in the period earned. Lease income for the Company's operating leases recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $123.4 million and $368.4 million, respectively.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-7, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715).” Under the new guidance, employers are required to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same statement of operations caption as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. Employers are required to present the other components of the net periodic benefit cost separately from the caption that includes the service costs and outside of any subtotal of operating profit and are required to disclose the caption used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost, if not presented separately on the statement of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-7 effective in the second quarter of 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the Company’s historically reported net income (loss) but resulted in a presentation reclassification which increased the Company’s historically reported operating profit by $0.1 million for the period from January 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020.

Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares that were outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities exercisable for or convertible into common stock were exercised for or converted into common stock. Dilutive common share equivalents are comprised of warrants, stock options outstanding under the Company’s equity incentive plans, unvested RSUs, and potential awards granted pursuant to the ESPP, each calculated using the treasury stock method; and shares issuable upon conversion of the senior convertible notes using the if-converted method. For warrants that are recorded as a liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, the calculation of diluted loss per share requires that, to the extent the average market price of the underlying shares for the reporting period exceeds the exercise price of the warrants and the presumed exercise of the warrants is dilutive to loss per share for the period, an adjustment is made to net loss used in the calculation to remove the change in fair value of the warrants from the numerator for the period. Likewise, an adjustment to the denominator is required to reflect the related dilutive shares, if any, under the treasury stock method. For all periods presented other than the three months ended September 30, 2019, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Company’s net loss position. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the net loss used in the calculation of diluted net loss per share was increased by $2.3 million to remove the decrease in fair value of common stock warrants based on the dilutive effect of assumed exercise, and the denominator was increased by 394,433 shares calculated under the treasury stock method.

The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities and manufactured products used as ingredients in food, feed, energy, and industrial products.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less.  The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606.  The Company recognized revenue from transportation service contracts of $423 million, $515 million, and $481 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20.

In general, it is Snap-on’s practice and intention to reinvest certain earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of 2020 year end, the company has not made a provision for incremental U.S. income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $319.1 million of such undistributed earnings that is deemed indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.  As a result of the Tax Act, which subjected the majority of the company’s undistributed foreign earnings to taxation for the 2017 tax year, the company can now repatriate non-U.S. cash in a tax efficient manner.  Accordingly, the company has reversed its prior assertion concerning the indefinite reinvestment of the majority of its undistributed foreign earnings and has recorded a deferred tax liability of $5.4 million for the incremental tax costs associated with the future potential repatriation of such earnings.

These services include, but are not limited to, treasury, financial planning and analysis, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting and information technology.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, APS voluntarily suspended disconnections of customers for nonpayment beginning March 13, 2020.  In addition, APS waived all late payment fees during this  suspension period.  On September 14, 2020, APS extended this suspension of disconnection of customers for nonpayment and waiver of late payment fees until December 31, 2020.

The Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on its Convertible Notes on diluted earnings per share because upon conversion the Company paid cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes converted and delivered shares of common stock in respect of the remainder of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes converted. The conversion spread had a dilutive impact on diluted earnings per share when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeded the conversion price. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there was no dilution as the Convertible Notes matured on April 15, 2019.

See Note 13 to for detailed information on the Convertible Notes offering.

From time to time, upon the customer’s written request, we recognize revenue when manufacturing is complete and the equipment is ready for shipment. At the customer’s request, we will bill the customer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The customer will formally request we ship the equipment per their direction from our manufacturing facility at a later specified date and that we segregate the equipment from our finished goods, such that they are not available to fill other orders. Per the customer’s agreement change of control is passed to the customer once the equipment is complete and ready for shipment. We have operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for many years, with consistent satisfactory results for both the customer and us. The credit terms on these agreements are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All control is shouldered by the customer and there are no exceptions to the customer’s commitment to accept and pay for the manufactured equipment. Revenues recognized related to bill and hold arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $0.9 million and $11.6 million, respectively.

Workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve a claim. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in healthcare costs, the results of any related litigation and with respect to workers’ compensation claims, changes in legislation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from actuarial projections. All of these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Based on our historical experience, in 2019 we changed our self-insurance reserves from the central estimate to the low end of the actuarial range of losses. The principal result of this change was a decrease in expense of $94 million and an increase in net income of $72 million, or $0.08 per share on a basic and diluted basis. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.

A discount rate is used to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations. To determine the discount rate for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, we use a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy our projected benefit payments. We believe the bond matching approach reflects the process we would employ to settle our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. In 2019, we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our U.S. pension and postretirement plans. Following a routine, periodic review of their standard bond matching tool which we reference to support discount rates, our external consultants refined their model to reflect the increased availability of longer duration high-quality corporate bonds, changes in the content and sources of available data and improvements in computational capabilities. We believe these refinements enhance the simulation of bond portfolios that match the plans' expected cash flows and result in a better estimate of the plan discount rates. These refinements resulted in an increase of approximately 10 basis points in the discount rates used to measure our plans, decreasing the total projected benefit obligation in our consolidated balance sheet at the December 31, 2019 measurement date by approximately $900 million and the resulting pre-tax mark-to-market charge within Other income and (expense) in our statements of consolidated income by approximately $810 million, and increasing net income by $616 million, or $0.71 per share on a basic and diluted basis. For our international plans, the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan, where available, or of a sample plan of similar duration, to a yield curve based on long-term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date. These assumptions are updated each measurement date, which is typically annually.

In 2017, the Company entered into an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement with Incyte for retifanlimab (formerly known as MGA012 and INCMGA0012), an investigational monoclonal antibody that inhibits programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) (Incyte License Agreement). Incyte has obtained exclusive worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of retifanlimab in all indications, while the Company retains the right to develop its pipeline assets in combination with retifanlimab. Under the terms of the Incyte License Agreement, Incyte paid the Company an upfront payment of $150.0 million in 2017.

---

The Company also has an agreement with Incyte, which was entered into in 2018, under which the Company is to perform development and manufacturing services for Incyte’s clinical needs of retifanlimab (Incyte Clinical Supply Agreement). The Company evaluated this agreement under ASC 606 and identified one performance obligation under the agreement: to perform services related to the development and manufacturing of the clinical supply of retifanlimab. The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to develop and manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The transaction price will be recognized using the input method reflecting the costs incurred (including resources consumed and labor hours expended) related to the manufacturing services. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $8.6 million, $22.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively, for services performed under this agreement. 

---

Due to the  short-term nature of the recognition period, the revenue associated with the tebotelimab performance obligation was recognized on a straight-line basis as the Company performed research and development activities under the agreement. The fixed consideration related to the margetuximab performance obligation was also  recognized on a straight-line basis as the Company performed research and development activities under the agreement due to the short-term nature of the recognition period. Straight-line recognition is materially consistent with the pattern of performance of the research and development activities of each product candidate. The variable consideration related to the margetuximab performance obligation was recognized upon certain regulatory achievements during 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $8.6 million, $16.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the Zai Lab Agreement. Revenue recognized during 2020 included net milestone revenue of $3.6 million, whereas revenue during 2019 and 2018 reflected the recognition of the deferred upfront payment. At December 31, 2019, $5.0 million of revenue was deferred under this agreement, all of which was current and recognized in 2020. 

---

The Company recognized revenue of $6.1 million when it satisfied its performance obligations under the agreements and transferred the MGD010 license and teplizumab assets to Provention in 2018.  The warrants were revalued at each reporting period based on the current Black-Scholes parameters until the warrants were exercised in July 2019. The resulting increase or decrease in the value of the warrants is reflected in Other income (expense) on the 2019 consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.  In July 2019, the Company exercised the warrants on a cashless basis, and subsequently sold all the shares of Provention common stock acquired through the exercise. No shares of Provention stock were held subsequent to the sale of stock in 2019. 

---

Revenue associated with each performance obligation was recognized as the research and development services were provided using a cost-based input method according to research and development costs incurred to date compared to estimated total research and development costs. The transfer of control occurred over this time period and, in management’s judgment, was the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. No revenue was recognized related to the MGD007 option during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recognized revenue of $1.9 million related to the MGD007 option.

---

The $10.0 million transaction price was being recognized over the expected research period, which was originally 30 months, using a cost-based input method to measure performance. Upon notice of Roche's intent to terminate the agreement in August 2019, the recognition period was adjusted to end in November 2019. There was no revenue recognized under this agreement during the year ended at December 31, 2020.  The Company recognized revenue under this agreement of $6.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as applicable, were based on 4.9 million, 4.6 million and 4.9 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

---

We also provide certain other services to residents at some of the senior living communities we manage for the account of DHC, such as rehabilitation and wellness services. At senior living communities we manage for the account of DHC where we provide rehabilitation and wellness services on an outpatient basis, the residents, third party payers or government programs pay us for those rehabilitation and wellness services. At senior living communities we manage for the account of DHC where we provide inpatient rehabilitation and wellness services, DHC generally pays us for these services and charges for such services are included in amounts charged to residents, third party payers or government programs. We earned revenues of $25,687 and $5,920 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for rehabilitation and wellness services we provided at senior living communities we manage for the account of DHC and that are payable by DHC.

Consistent with our historical accounting for these services at our managed communities, the revenues earned at these clinics that were previously located at senior living communities that we leased from DHC but as of the Conversion Time, we now manage, no longer constitute intercompany revenues and thus will not be eliminated in consolidation and will be recognized and reported as rehabilitation and wellness services in our consolidated statements of operations.

Brighthouse Services currently provides, and previously MetLife provided, certain services to the Company, each using an allocation methodology under certain agreements for such services. These services include, but are not limited to, treasury, financial planning and analysis, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting and information technology.

The Company reported loss before income taxes of $31,995 and $26,108 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The higher loss before income taxes as compared to the prior year was primarily caused by higher operating expenses of $23,061.  The increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by an increase in general and administrative expense resulting from costs associated with the employee exit costs as a result of restructuring activities, the abandonment of a portion of the Company's office locations and increased reserves associated with indirect taxes. Also attributing was an increase in engineering and development expenses in connection with the Company's continued focus on further enhancing the service offerings within the Vonage Communications Platform. The increase in operating expenses was slightly offset by decrease in sales and marketing expenses due to lower media marketing costs along with certain marketing events being cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other intangible assets consist of vivoPharm’s customer list and trade name, which historically were amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of ten years. FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment,” provides guidance for the impairment of long-lived assets that are classified as held and used. In particular, the relevant guidance is included in the “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Asset” subsections of ASC 360-10. Long-lived assets are required to be tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset group to which they belong may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over the fair value of the asset group. VivoPharm experienced an operating loss of approximately $1.5 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 which was determined to be an indicator of impairment.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of December 31, 2020, along with the net proceeds from the underwritten public offering in January 2021 (Note 23), will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development and clinical manufacturing of its and its collaborators' product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $170,521 and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $1,823,390. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development, reduce uses of cash for operating and investing activities for non-healthcare functions, obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, successfully commercialize its product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

Since the Company expects to settle the principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes in cash, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. For the 2021 Notes, the conversion spread of 12.3 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $77.64 per share. For the 2024 Notes, the conversion spread of 20.1 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company’s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $57.14 per share. For the 2025 Notes, the conversion spread of 24.1 million shares will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company's common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $41.50 per share. Since the average market price of the common stock is below the conversion price for all convertible notes for all periods presented, the Convertible Notes are anti-dilutive.

Net income (loss) of foreign subsidiaries was $(55.7) million, $2.5 million, and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Generally, it has been the Company's practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations.   As previously noted, the Tax Act made significant changes to the taxation of undistributed earnings, requiring that all previously untaxed earnings and profits of the Company's controlled foreign operations be subjected to the transition tax. Since these earnings have now been subjected to U.S. federal tax, they would only be potentially subject to limited other taxes, including foreign withholding and certain state taxes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for foreign withholdings and state taxes on its undistributed international earnings or losses of its foreign subsidiaries since it intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the United States.  The Company has estimated that the amount of the unrecorded deferred tax liability related to undistributed international earnings is approximately $1.8 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, 28,533,271 weighted-average potentially issuable shares with respect to the Notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect was anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 28,913,665 and 29,674,442 weighted-average potentially issuable shares with respect to the Notes, respectively, were included in the dilutive earnings per share denominator.

In accordance with the Company’s policies of determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and accounting for earnings per share, the net income (loss) per common share is adjusted for earnings distributed through declared dividends (if any) and allocated to all participating securities (weighted average common shares outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding) under the two-class method. Under this method, allocations were made to 341,673, 402,380 and 368,912 of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

---

Restricted shares of common stock are considered participating securities as these stock-based awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, unless and until a forfeiture occurs, and these awards must be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were 187,283, 217,623 and 195,281, respectively, unvested shares of restricted stock on a weighted average basis that were considered participating securities. Participating securities are included in the computation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method if the impact is dilutive. Other potentially dilutive common shares from the Company’s performance units and forward sales agreements are considered when calculating diluted EPS.

(“Topic 340‑40”).

As of March 31, 2021, the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $119.0 million and its accumulated deficit was $791.1 million. The Company estimates that its significantly increased current cash and cash equivalents balance, which includes cash proceeds received from its sales agreement with SVB Leerink LLC to sell shares of common stock from time to time through an at-the-market equity offering program, as well as cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of its long-term investment in Arvelle Therapeutics B.V. ("Arvelle"), is sufficient to support operations beyond the twelve month period following the date that these consolidated financial statements were issued, including beyond the expected dates of major upcoming milestones for the Company's AXO-AAV-GM1 gene therapy program for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis. As such, the Company has determined that there is no longer substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for the one-year period following the date that these consolidated financial statements and footnotes were issued. These estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects.

The Company changed its presentation of reportable segments related to the allocation of corporate overhead costs to reflect the presentation used by the company's chief operational decision-making group ("CODM") to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the Company’s reportable segments and to assess segment performance. Historically, and through July 31, 2020, the Company’s total corporate overhead costs were allocated and reported within each reportable segment. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company changed the corporate overhead allocation methodology to only include corporate costs incurred on behalf of its operating segments, which includes accounts payable, accounts receivable, insurance, audit, supply chain, health, safety and environmental and others. The remaining unallocated corporate costs are reported as a reconciling item in the Company’s segment reporting disclosures. See Note 15 for additional information. The change is reflected retroactively in the accompanying financial statements which resulted in a decrease to the total corporate overhead costs allocated to our three reportable segments for the year ended January 31, 2021, and 2020 of $62.0 and $54.7, respectively.

The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is also primarily due to the near break-even loss in 2020 of $3.4 million, which caused an exaggerated impact for nearly all adjustments impacting the rate. For 2020, the largest increases in the effective tax rate over 2019 are tax benefits from statute of limitations expiring on certain uncertain tax positions and the mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, offset by the adverse tax impacts associated with the nondeductible goodwill impairment to the Wave reporting unit. Due to the pretax loss in 2020, the tax benefits increased the effective tax rate while tax expense decreased the effective tax rate.

In accordance with its policy, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that the actual lives of certain manufacturing equipment at its manufacturing facilities were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As a result, effective June 29, 2019, the Company changed its estimate of the useful lives of its manufacturing equipment from a range of three to five years to a range of three to seven years. The effect of this change in estimate increased the net income by $134 million for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2020 and increased the diluted earnings per share by $0.51 for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2020.

Arena License Agreements in Fiscal Year 2020. During Fiscal Year 2021, the use of The Garden for Knicks and Rangers home games resumed under the government-mandated capacity restrictions and safety protocols accordingly, the Company recognized $21,345 of revenues under the Arena License Agreements. 

---

The Arena License Agreements provide that license fees are not required to be paid by MSG Sports during periods when The Garden is unavailable for use due to a force majeure event.

Since our contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. In addition, changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. Changes in estimates unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $19 in fiscal year 2021. Changes in estimates favorably impacted operating income by approximately $7 and $37 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.

Basic
net income (loss) per share represents net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. The dilutive effect of potential common shares, consisting of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock, is determined
using the treasury stock method. For fiscal 2021 and 2019, approximately 134,000 and 125,000 respectively, of weighted average stock
options were included in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding
for fiscal 2020 does not include the potential common shares from stock options and unvested restricted stock because to do so would

The increased income tax provision for the current period was largely impacted by an increase in pretax income across several jurisdictions and partially offset by an increase in discrete benefit items including certain equity compensation deductions.  Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix, changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, special items, certain equity related compensation, and other discrete tax items that may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2020 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Company incurred net losses of $29.1 million and $72.6 million, respectively. The Company expects to continue to incur significant operating and net losses, as well as negative cash flows from operations, for the foreseeable future as it continues to develop its gene therapy product candidates and prepares for potential future regulatory approvals and commercialization of its products, if approved. The Company has not generated any revenue to date and does not expect to generate product revenue unless and until it successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval for at least one of its product candidates, and its current cash and cash equivalents balance will not be sufficient to complete all necessary development activities and commercially launch its products. While the Company anticipates that its current cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to sustain operations into the second calendar quarter of 2022, such expectation is subject to a number of significant variables and may not occur, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 7,767,874 and 7,575,168 common shares held in a grantor trust as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. For the period ended March 31, 2020, diluted shares have been reduced by 2.0 million to reflect the anti-dilutive effect of common equivalent shares.

In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-7, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715).” Under the new guidance, employers are required to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same statement of operations caption as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. Employers are required to present the other components of the net periodic benefit cost separately from the caption that includes the service costs and outside of any subtotal of operating profit and are required to disclose the caption used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost, if not presented separately on the statement of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-7 effective in the second quarter of 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the Company’s historically reported net income (loss) but resulted in a presentation reclassification which increased the Company’s historically reported operating profit by $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of March 31, 2021 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development, and clinical manufacturing of its and its collaborators' product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $17,318 and, as of March 31, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of $1,840,708. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development, reduce uses of cash for operating and investing activities for non-healthcare functions, obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, successfully commercialize its product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

The Company's leases typically have escalators that are either based on a stated percentage or an index such as consumer price index ("CPI"). In addition, most of the Company's leases include nonlease components, such as reimbursement of operating expenses as additional rent, or include the reimbursement of expected operating expenses as part of the lease payment. The Company adopted an accounting policy to combine lease and nonlease components. Rent escalators based on indices and reimbursements of operating expenses that are not included in the lease rate are considered variable lease payments. Variable payments are recognized in the period earned. Lease income for the Company's operating leases recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $128.4 million.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted a new economic scenario generator to calculate the fair value of the GMIB reinsurance contract asset and GMxB derivative features liability, eliminating reliance on AXA for scenario production. The new economic scenario generator allows for a tighter calibration of U.S. indices, better reflecting the Company’s actual portfolio. The net impact of the new economic scenario generator resulted in an increase in income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes of $165 million, and an increase to net income (loss) of $130 million during 2020.

During March 2021, we identified two errors related to our accounting for the disposal of the Air Springs portion of the heavy-duty trucking business that closed in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Such errors resulted in an understatement of the pre-tax loss on disposal for this disposition by approximately $2.0 million and an overstatement of net income by approximately $1.5 million in our previously issued consolidated financial statements. Net income for calendar 2020 was approximately $184.8 million.  We evaluated the errors and concluded that they were not material to our previously issued consolidated financial statements and recorded the pre-tax loss on disposal as an out-of-period adjustment in other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the first quarter of 2021.

We have operating leases with tenants that expire at various dates through 2040. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $21,946,000 and $21,463,000 of real estate revenue, respectively, related to operating lease payments, of which $4,944,000 and $4,455,000, respectively, was for variable lease payments. As of March 31, 2021, the following table sets forth the undiscounted cash flows for future minimum base rents due under operating leases for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and for each of the next four years ending December 31 and thereafter for the properties that we wholly own:

---

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $4,000 and $7,000, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 45,000 and 43,500 nonvested shares, respectively, of our restricted common stock outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 208 redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership outstanding, but such units were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods.

, would have resulted in a net loss of $(0.12) and $(6.14) per share for Class C shares for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a net loss of $(0.12) and $(6.14) per share for Class S shares for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any difference in net loss per share if allocated under this method primarily reflects the lower effective distributions per share for Class S shareholders as a result of the payment of the deferred commission to the Class S distributor of these shares, and also reflects the impact of the timing of the declaration of the distributions relative to the time the shares were outstanding.

) because the shares to be delivered are not participating securities as they do not have voting rights and are not entitled to participate in dividends until they are issued. Computation of net loss per share available to common stockholders for the three months ended April 3, 2021 also excludes the dilutive effect of the Notes because the Company recorded a net loss and their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Computation of net income per share available to common stockholders for the three months ended March 28, 2020 includes the dilutive effect of 4,159,406 shares issuable under stock options with exercise prices below the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last trading day of the applicable period, and 33,602 RSUs, and 55,051 shares of common stock that were issuable to

From time to time, we will enter the marketplace to purchase product in order to satisfy obligations under contracts with  our customers. When we purchase product for this purpose, we are the principal in the transaction and recognize revenue on a gross basis. As discussed in Note 7—Equity Method Investment, we have transactions in the normal course of business with PLNL, reflecting our obligation to purchase 50% of the ammonia produced by PLNL at current market prices. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, in addition to products purchased from PLNL, we recognized $32 million of revenue from sales of granular urea, which we purchased in order to satisfy obligations under contracts with our customers due to lower production experienced as a result of Winter Storm Uri. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, other than products purchased from PLNL, products purchased in the marketplace in order to satisfy obligations under contracts with our customers were not material.

Effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021, we changed our method of inventory costing from average cost to FIFO. This change in accounting principle is preferable because in an environment with continuously changing production costs FIFO more closely matches the actual cost of goods sold with the revenues from sales of those specific units, better represents the actual cost of inventories remaining on hand at any period-end, and improves comparability with our semiconductor industry peers. The change to FIFO was not material to any prior periods, nor is the cumulative effect of $133 million material to the second quarter of 2021. As such, prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted, and the cumulative effect was reported as an increase to cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2021 of $133 million, with an offsetting reduction to beginning inventories. This charge resulted in a corresponding reduction to operating income, a $128 million reduction to net income, and an $0.11 reduction to diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021.

The Company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the net loss was $34,693, compared to net loss of $16,926 in the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $315,112. The future success of the Company is dependent on, among other factors, its ability to identify and develop its product candidates and ultimately upon its ability to attain profitable operations. The Company has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expense to support such research and development. Net losses and negative operating cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders' equity and working capital.

While the Company generated $4.5 million of revenues from the sale of its test kits, there still remains uncertainty of future revenue from sales of its test kits. The Company is devoting most of its efforts to the sales and marketing and research and development of its test kits. The Company is subject to a number of product risks, including the receipt of regulatory approvals for additional indications of the COVID-19 test kit and timing thereof, size of the market opportunity, demand from the public and members of the medical community for the COVID-19 test kit and rate of adoption of the COVID-19 test kit. The commercial success of the COVID-19 test kit will initially be dependent upon physicians, and healthcare providers accepting and adopting our test kit. The Company is also subject to risks related to compliance with government regulations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on third-parties, product liability, and dependence on key individuals.

During the first quarter of 2021, we modified the useful lives of certain of our Pipeline and related facilities and Storage, terminal and rail facilities to useful lives of 10 to 50 years from useful lives of 10 to 70 years to reflect current expectations given our future operating and commercial outlook. These depreciable life adjustments will prospectively increase depreciation expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, these reductions increased depreciation expense by approximately $18 million, which resulted in a decrease to both basic and diluted net income per Class A share of approximately $0.02 from what it would have been absent the change in useful lives.

In October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Incyte pursuant to which the Company is entitled to manufacture a portion of the global commercial supply needs for retifanlimab (Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement). Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement will expire upon the expiration of Incyte’s obligation to pay royalties under the Incyte License Agreement.  The Company evaluated this agreement under ASC 606 and identified one performance obligation under the agreement: to perform services related to manufacturing the commercial supply of retifanlimab. The transaction price is based on a fixed price per batch of bulk drug substance to be manufactured and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The transaction price will be recognized using the input method reflecting the costs incurred (including resources consumed and labor hours expended) related to the manufacturing services.    During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $3.1 million for services performed under the Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement.

During 2019, the Company entered into two agreements under which the Company is to perform manufacturing services for Zai Lab’s clinical needs of margetuximab and tebotelimab (Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements).  The Company evaluated the agreements under ASC 606 and determined that they should be accounted for as a single contract and identified two performance obligations within that contract: to perform services related to manufacturing the clinical supply of each of margetuximab and tebotelimab.  The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date.  During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to the Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements.

The Arena License Agreements provide that license fees are not required to be paid by MSG Sports during periods when The Garden is unavailable for use due to a force majeure event. As a result of government-mandated suspension of events at The Garden beginning on March 13, 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Garden was not available for use by MSG Sports from the effective date of the Arena License Agreements through the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2021, and, accordingly, the Company did not record any operating lease revenue for this arrangement during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2021. Starting December 2020, The Garden reopened for games of the Knicks and the Rangers but initially fans were not permitted to attend due to governmental restrictions. The restrictions were partially lifted during February 2021 with limited  fans permitted to attend (10% capacity).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Since inception, the Company has incurred recurring losses including net losses of $61.3 million and $266.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $815.8 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $502.2 million as of March 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations.

We have calculated earnings per share (“EPS”) under the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation methodology whereby EPS for each class of common stock and participating securities is calculated according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had 0.3 million and 0.2 million weighted average unvested shares outstanding, respectively, which are considered participating securities. Therefore, we have allocated our earnings for basic and diluted EPS between common shares and unvested shares; the portion of earnings allocated to the unvested shares is reflected as “earnings allocated to unvested shares” in the reconciliation below.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $45 million in continuing operations on a pre-tax income of $267 million compared to an income tax benefit of $75 million on pre-tax income of $85 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the provision for income taxes was calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. In calculating “ordinary” income, non‑taxable income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was deducted from pre-tax income or loss in the determination of the annualized effective tax rate used to calculate income taxes for the quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we utilized the discrete effective tax rate method, as allowed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740-270-30-18, “Income Taxes–Interim Reporting,” to calculate the interim income tax provision. The discrete method is applied when application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year-to-date period as if it were the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. We believe that the use of this discrete method in 2020 was more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method as the estimated annual effective tax rate method was not reliable due to the high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pre-tax income due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving guidance by the government on utilization of grant funds. The reconciliation between the amount of recorded income tax expense (benefit) and the amount calculated at the statutory federal tax rate is shown in the following table:

The suite-reservation performance obligations are considered an operating lease as the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified asset and has the right to direct its use. The associated revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The remaining term on the Company's operating lease performance obligations approximates 2.0 years. The Company utilizes a cost-plus model to determine the stand-alone selling price of the lease component to allocate contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company's lease revenues were $18.7 million, which is included within contract development and manufacturing services in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

In April 2020, the FASB issued a question-and-answer document (the “Lease Modification Q&A”) focused on the application of lease accounting guidance to lease concessions provided as a result of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. The Lease Modification Q&A clarifies that entities may elect not to evaluate whether lease-related relief provided to mitigate the economic effects of COVID-19 pandemic is a lease modification under ASC 842. Instead, an entity that elects not to evaluate whether a concession directly related to COVID-19 pandemic, which does not substantially increase either its rights as lessor or the obligations of the tenant, is a modification can elect whether to apply the modification guidance. An entity should apply the election consistently to leases with similar characteristics and similar circumstances. NHI has elected not to apply the modification guidance under ASC 842 and has accounted for rent concessions as variable lease payments when applicable, recorded as rental income when received. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company provided $4.2 million in lease concessions as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed in more detail in Note 7.

Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

In April 2017, the FCA announced an investigation relating to suspected competition law breaches in the aviation and aerospace broking industry, which, for Aon in 2016, represented less than $100 million in global revenue. The European Commission assumed jurisdiction over the investigation in place of the FCA, and the European Commission has now closed its investigation. Other antitrust agencies outside the E.U. are conducting formal or informal investigations regarding these matters. Aon intends to work diligently with all antitrust agencies concerned to ensure they can carry out their work as efficiently as possible.

The
Company’s unaudited condensed statement of operations include a presentation of income per share for common stock subject to redemption
in a manner similar to the two-class method of income per share. Net (loss) income per share of common stock, basic and diluted for shares
of Class A common stock are calculated by dividing the income (loss) earned on investments held in the Trust Account, net of applicable
taxes and working capital amounts available to be withdrawn from the Trust Account, which was $0 for the three and six months ended June
30, 2021, by the weighted average number of Class A common stock outstanding for the period. Net (loss) income per share of common stock,
basic and diluted for shares of Class B common stock is calculated by dividing the net income of approximately $6.2 million, less income
attributable to Class A common stock by the weighted average number of Class B common stock outstanding for the periods.

The
transaction is contingent upon the Company’s ability to secure debt financing for the cash portion of the purchase price. The financing
will be secured by the assets of SalSon, and it will likely rely exclusively on SalSon’s assets and financial performance. SalSon
currently is profitable with almost $100 million in annual revenues. If the debt financing for the cash portion of the purchase price
cannot be obtained, then the transaction will not close.

Company’s cash used in operating activities was $1,566,970 and $6,017,388, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents
are $35,918,667. The Company anticipates continuing to use operating cash due to: (i) a sustained reduction in sales; (ii) investments
in new markets, new lines of business, and new products, and (iii) costs associated with the due diligence of purchasing strategic assets
and companies. The Company believes that funds from the $30 million convertible loan received from Decentralized Sharing Systems, Inc.
on April 5, 2021 (see Note 4), provides the Company with sufficient liquidity to sustain the Company’s plans and operations at
current levels over the next twelve months.

In determining the most appropriate reportable segments, we consider operating segments’ economic and other characteristics, including home floor plans, average selling prices, gross margin percentage, geographical proximity, production construction processes, suppliers, subcontractors, regulatory environments, customer type and underlying demand and supply. Each operating segment follows the same accounting policies and is managed by our management team. We have no inter-segment sales, as all sales are to external customers. Operating results for each segment may not be indicative of the results for such segment had it been an independent, stand-alone entity for the periods presented.

The
Company has incurred losses since Inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $5,470,990 as of June 30, 2021 that includes a loss
of $304,628 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there
is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are
issued.

---

The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to undertake further exploration
and development activities and ultimately generating profitable operations from its oil and natural gas interests in the future. The
Company’s current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of its current assets to meet its current expenditure requirements
and the accuracy of management’s estimates of those requirements. Should those estimates be materially incorrect, the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern may be impaired. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. During the six months ended
June 30, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $6.6 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $219.4 million.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The accounting policies of each segment are the same as those followed by the company as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are priced as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Accordingly, the ECS segment records intersegment revenue and manufacturing profit on hardware and software shipments to customers under contracts of other segments. These segments, in turn, record customer revenue and marketing profits on such shipments of company hardware and software to customers.  In the company’s consolidated statements of income, the manufacturing costs of products sourced from the ECS segment and sold to other segments’ customers are reported in cost of revenue for these other segments.  Also included in the ECS segment’s sales and gross profit are sales of hardware and software sold to other segments for internal use in their engagements. The amount of such profit included in gross profit of the ECS segment for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $0.4 million and zero, respectively. The amount for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $1.1 million and zero, respectively. The sales and profit on these transactions are eliminated in Corporate.

The diluted weighted average number of common units is computed based on the weighted average number of common units plus the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period, which include (i) our Series A preferred units and (ii) our equity-indexed compensation plan awards. When applying the if-converted method prescribed by FASB guidance, the possible conversion of approximately 71 million Series A preferred units, on a weighted-average basis, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income/(loss) per common unit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 as the effect was antidilutive for each period. Our equity-indexed compensation plan awards that contemplate the issuance of common units are considered potentially dilutive unless (i) they become vested only upon the satisfaction of a performance condition and (ii) that performance condition has yet to be satisfied. Equity-indexed compensation plan awards that are deemed to be dilutive during the period are reduced by a hypothetical common unit repurchase based on the remaining unamortized fair value, as prescribed by the treasury stock method in guidance issued by the FASB. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, equity-indexed compensation awards were dilutive; however, the approximately 0.1 million and 0.4 million awards, respectively, on a weighted-average basis, did not change the presentation of diluted weighted average common units outstanding or diluted net income per common unit for the period presented. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2020, approximately 0.7 million and 0.5 million equity-indexed compensation plan awards, respectively, on a weighted-average basis, were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common unit as the effect was antidilutive. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our equity-indexed compensation plan awards.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at June 30, 2021 and 2020, is considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-7, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715).” Under the new guidance, employers are required to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same statement of operations caption as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. Employers are required to present the other components of the net periodic benefit cost separately from the caption that includes the service costs and outside of any subtotal of operating profit and are required to disclose the caption used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost, if not presented separately on the statement of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-7 effective in the second quarter of 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the Company’s historically reported net income (loss) but resulted in a presentation reclassification which increased the Company’s historically reported operating profit by $0.1 million for the six months ended June 25, 2020.

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $1,000 and $2,000, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 and $1,000 and $9,000, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.

of July 31, 2021, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $19,646,163 and continuously incurred a net operating profit of $19,112

From time to time we recognize revenue when manufacturing is complete and the equipment is ready for shipment. At the customer’s request, we will bill the customer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The customer will formally request that we ship the equipment per their direction from our manufacturing facility at a later specified date and that we segregate the equipment from our finished goods, such that they are not available to fill other orders. Per the customer’s agreement change of control is passed to the customer once the equipment is complete and ready for shipment. We have operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for many years, with consistent and satisfactory results for both the customer and us. The credit terms on these agreements are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All control is maintained by the customer and there are no exceptions to the customer’s commitment to accept and pay for the manufactured equipment. There was no revenue recognized for bill and hold arrangements for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Revenue recognized related to bill and hold arrangements for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was approximately $852,000.

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements, for the nine months ended July 31, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $683,863 and used cash
in operations of $614,120, and at July 31, 2021, had a stockholders’ deficit of $58,765. These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that these financial statements are
issued. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s October
31, 2020, financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

During the first quarter of 2021, the Company reclassified approximately $92 million of pre-tax unrealized gains from AOCI to investment income, net of related expenses associated with investments in limited partnerships and private equity funds for which it utilizes the equity method of accounting. The unrealized gains should have been recognized directly in investment income in the same prior periods they were reported by the investees. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $70 million of pre-tax gains in investment related gains (losses), net, associated with investments in limited partnerships considered to be investment companies in order to adjust the carrying value from cost less impairments to a fair value approach, using the net asset value (“NAV”) per share or its equivalent. Had the adjustments been recorded in the years they were reported by the investees, the Company estimates it would have recognized approximately $102 million, $(2) million, $1 million and $10 million of pre-tax income (loss) in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

During the first quarter of 2021, we modified the useful lives of certain of our Pipelines and related facilities and Storage, terminal and rail facilities to useful lives of 10 to 50 years from useful lives of 10 to 70 years to reflect current expectations given our future operating and commercial outlook. These depreciable life adjustments will prospectively increase depreciation expense. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, these reductions in useful lives increased depreciation expense by approximately $18 million and $36 million, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to PAGP of $4 million and $7 million, respectively, from what these amounts would have been absent the change in useful lives. The impact to both basic and diluted net income per Class A share was approximately $0.01 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and approximately $0.04 for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, during the three
months ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $612,235 and used $562,701 of cash in our operating activities. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the
financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 7,767,874 and 7,575,168 common shares held in a grantor trust as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following
the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The Company has incurred continuing losses since 2011, including a loss
of $313,820 for the six months
ended June 30, 2021. As a result of the steep global economic slowdown that began in March 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”)
spread, oil and gas demand and prices realized from oil and gas sales declined sharply. While the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and the
global economy oil and gas prices have recovered, future spikes in COVID-19 infection rates could result in declines in global economic
activity and oil and gas prices. Any such future declines in prices would adversely affect the Company’s revenues and profitability.

the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized income of $417,849 as a result of other income and foreign exchange
gain offset by general administrative expenses, professional fees and interest expenses. The Company had a working capital deficiency
of $1,633,211 as of June 30, 2021, which deficiency raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the year
ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $66,176 and has generated minimal revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company has certain performance obligations that are considered an operating lease as the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified asset and has the right to direct its use. The associated revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The remaining term on the Company's operating lease performance obligations approximates 2.0 years. The Company utilizes a cost-plus model to determine the stand-alone selling price of the lease component to allocate contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company's lease revenues were $16.9 million and $35.6 million, respectively, which is included within contract development and manufacturing services in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 the Company's lease revenues were de minimis.

Our second quarter and six month results were materially impacted by these necessary actions when compared to periods prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our overall revenue for the quarter increased by $501.9 million to $575.9 million and for the six months decreased by $573.2 million to $866.6 million as compared to the same period of the prior year. The revenue increase during the quarter was primarily in our Ticketing and Concerts segments as a result of more events going on sale and occurring globally, along with lower refunds, during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease in revenue during the first six months of 2021 was primarily in our Concerts segment largely due to normal pre-pandemic operations from January through mid-March of 2020 compared to a full shut-down for the first quarter of 2021. The revenue recognized in our Concerts segment in 2020 included the results of  the shows that occurred prior to the stoppage of events in mid-March. We had a limited number of shows in the first six months of 2021, largely in Australia, New Zealand and the United States.

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company did not carry an income tax provision amount as the Company does not recognize tax benefits from current year tax losses in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  The Company’s tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $45.9 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions due to the valuation allowance.  At June 30, 2021, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to amortization of the Notes.

Farms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $20.6 million (62.6%) and $6.7 million (20.5%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2021.  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster (such as an earthquake, wildfire, or flood) occur or climate change impact the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  None of our farms in California or Florida have been materially impacted by the recent wildfires or hurricanes that occurred in those respective regions.  In addition, in light of the ongoing drought taking place in the western U.S., all of our farms in the region have independent (and, in most cases, multiple) sources of water, in addition to rainfall, and have not been materially impacted by the current drought conditions.  No other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of our total lease revenue recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2021.

Upon completion of the sale, Bickford satisfied the terms of our prior agreement that contingently waived $2.1 million in rental income for the third quarter of 2020. These properties were part of our ongoing negotiations for the sale to Bickford of nine properties being leased to Bickford. We continue to explore our options for the remaining three properties, which could include a sale to a third party, re-tenanting, or retaining the existing lease with Bickford.

---

In addition to the concessions noted above, we have agreed with Bickford to defer $1.5 million in contractual rent due for July 2021. We have agreed with Holiday to defer an additional $0.6 million of contractual rent due for July 2021. We also agreed to utilize $1.8 million of the lease deposit with Holiday as contractual rent with $1.2 million applied towards second quarter of 2021 contractual rent and $0.6 million towards July 2021 contractual rent. The balance of the lease deposit at June 30, 2021 was $9.4 million. We have reached agreement with two other tenants regarding additional rent deferrals of approximately $0.9 million for the third quarter 2021. We are in discussions with one other tenant for a rent deferral of approximately $0.7 million for the remainder of 2021.

Products and services provided under long-term contracts represent a significant portion of sales in the Albany Engineered Composites segment and we account for these contracts using the percentage of completion (actual cost to estimated cost) method. That method requires significant judgment and estimation, which could be considerably different if the underlying circumstances were to change. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the period the change occurs. Changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts could be caused by increases or decreases in the contract value, revisions to customer delivery requirements, updated labor or overhead rates, factors affecting the supply chain, changes in the evaluation of contract risks and opportunities, or other factors. Changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts increased operating income by $4.3 million and $3.7 million for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively.  Adjustments in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts increased operating income by $7.4 million and $6.4 million for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively.

Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flow from operations. Net losses were $36.7 million and $64.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and $25.6 million and $44.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively.

The
Company was incorporated on September 28, 2017 and has not generated revenues to date. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the
Company had a net loss of $12,558,103 and cash of $8,610,125 at June 30, 2021. The Company will be conducting medical research and development,
and the time at which the Company will begin generating revenue is unknown. These factors indicate substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes, however, that the funds raised by the IPO, the September 2020 Offering,
and the offering, sale, and issuance by the Company of a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note pursuant to a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the “January 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement”) will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operation for
at least the next 12 months. Because of these factors, the Company believes that this alleviates substantial doubt in connection with
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern.

The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, using a modified retrospective approach. Effective January 1, 2021, the dilutive effect of the Company’s convertible and exchangeable notes is calculated using the if-converted method. Prior to the adoption, the dilutive effect of the convertible and exchangeable notes was calculated using the treasury stock method. Since all of the Company’s convertible and exchangeable notes require net share settlement, using the if-converted method results in a similar dilutive effect as using the treasury stock method under the previous accounting standard, due to the fact that only in-the-money shares are included in the dilutive effect. The Company had 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares of dilutive effect from its convertible and exchangeable notes during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021.

As
of June 30, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $9,540,987 and net loss of $98,330 and net cash used in operations of $0
for the period ended June 30, 2021. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for professional

the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet with the Company’s obligations as they become due. However,
there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.

During the three months ended June 30, 2021, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects increased consolidated gross margin by 0.8%, which resulted in increases in operating income of $5.1 million, net income of $3.6 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.21. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects increased consolidated gross margin by 0.3%, which resulted in increases in operating income of $3.9 million, net income of $2.7 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.16.

---

During the three months ended June 30, 2020, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects increased consolidated gross margin by 0.2%, which resulted in increases in operating income of $1.2 million, net income of $0.9 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.05. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 0.1%, which resulted in decreases in operating income of $0.7 million, net income of $0.5 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.03.

We also excluded 55,084 unvested stock awards granted to certain employees from the computations of diluted weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding because they are subject to certain performance-based annual vesting conditions which had not been achieved by July 31, 2021. Assuming the performance-criteria had been achieved as of July 31, 2021, the incremental dilutive impact would have been 17,216 shares.

Management
does not expect existing cash as of June 30, 2021 to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months
from the issuance date of these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes
the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2021,
the Company has incurred losses totaling $11.9 million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue from operations, and will
require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to finance operating
costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital through equity offerings,
debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts.

Prior to acquisition, Partsmaster leased parts washer machines to customers through its Torrents leasing program. The Torrents leasing program comprised a minor portion of the Partsmaster business. The Company will continue the leasing program for the foreseeable future. These leases are classified as operating leases. The leased machines are recognized as fixed assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and the leasing revenue is recognized on a straight line basis. The Torrents machine leasing program generated $0.7 million and $1.4 million of revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The Company has adopted the practical expedient not to separate non-lease components that would be within the scope of ASC 606 from the associated lease components as the relevant criteria under ASC 842 are met.

Segment profit for the 2021 Quarter and 2021 Period included a project charge of $138 million (or $0.72 per share) for procurement and subcontractor cost growth, delays and disruptions in the schedule of a legacy infrastructure project. We believe that these cost growth factors may be at least partially recoverable under the contract. However, we expect that it will require several quarters to analyze recoverability and negotiate with our client before recognizing incremental revenue for these factors. The decline in segment profit in the 2021 Period was partially offset by the favorable resolution of a long-standing customer dispute on a rail project. We also sold our interest in an infrastructure joint venture and recognized a gain of $20 million during the 2021 Quarter and 2021 Period. Intercompany revenue for our professional staffing business, excluded from the amounts shown above, was $69 million and $139 million for the 2021 Quarter and 2021 Period, respectively, and $62 million and $139 million for the 2020 Quarter and 2020 Period, respectively.

The
Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in our
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has had a net loss from operations of $1,745,257 and $1,873,806
for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $15,113,058
at June 30, 2021 and has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and
to allow it to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

During the three and six month period ended June 30, 2021, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of $4 million and $16 million, respectively, which reflects income tax expense in countries where the Company is profitable; accrued withholding taxes; ongoing assessments related to the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits; the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and/or recognize expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions (including the U.S.) due to valuation allowances; and other non-recurring tax items, including enacted tax law changes. Pretax losses in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $34 million and $101 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate in those years.

, would have resulted in a net loss of $(0.13) and $(0.28) per share of Class C common stock for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a net loss of $(0.13) and $(0.28) per share of Class S common stock for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The two-class method would have resulted in a net loss per share of $(0.25) and $(6.39) of Class C common stock for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $(0.25) and $(6.39) of Class S common stock for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any difference in net loss per share if allocated under this method primarily reflects the lower effective distributions per share for Class S stockholders as a result of the payment of the deferred commission to the Class S distributor of these shares, and also reflects the impact of the timing of the declaration of the distributions relative to the time the shares were outstanding.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of June 30, 2021 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development, and clinical manufacturing of its and its collaborators' product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $37,368 and, as of June 30, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of $1,860,758. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development, reduce uses of cash for operating and investing activities for non-healthcare functions, adequately satisfy or renegotiate long-term debt obligations, obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, successfully commercialize its product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP which contemplates continuation of the Company as a
going-concern basis. The going-concern basis assumes that assets are realized, and liabilities are settled in the ordinary course of
business at amounts disclosed in the financial statements. Although the Company has accumulated deficit of $19,651,820 as of October
31, 2021, and it has reported a net loss of $24,769 during the nine months ended October 31, 2021. The Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm expressed in its report on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2021 a substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the Company’s effort in improving its operations
and the significant working capital increase as of October 31, 2021, the management believes that the substantial doubt has been alleviated.

In January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020, and those acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $591 million and $2.1 billion and an increase in net income of $460 million and $1.7 billion, or $0.69 and $2.50 per basic share and $0.68 and $2.46 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.

The
Trust has elected to be treated for tax purposes as a REIT, which means that it is exempt from U.S. federal income tax if a sufficient
portion of its annual income is distributed to its shareholders, and if certain other requirements are met. In order for the Trust to
maintain its REIT qualification, at least 90% of its ordinary taxable annual income must be distributed to shareholders. As of December
31, 2020, the last tax return completed to date, the Trust has a net operating loss of $22.7 million, which may reduce or eliminate this
requirement.

From time to time we recognize revenue when manufacturing is complete and the equipment is ready for shipment. At the customer’s request, we will bill the customer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The customer will formally request that we ship the equipment per their direction from our manufacturing facility at a later specified date and that we segregate the equipment from our finished goods, such that they are not available to fill other orders. Per the customer’s agreement change of control is passed to the customer once the equipment is complete and ready for shipment. We have operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for many years, with consistent and satisfactory results for both the customer and us. The credit terms on these agreements are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All control is maintained by the customer and there are no exceptions to the customer’s commitment to accept and pay for the manufactured equipment. There was no revenue recognized for bill and hold arrangements for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Revenue recognized related to bill and hold arrangements for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was approximately $852,000.

The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to develop and manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The transaction price will be recognized using the input method reflecting the costs incurred (including resources consumed and labor hours expended) related to the manufacturing services.  During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for services performed under the Incyte Clinical Supply Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $1.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for services performed under the Incyte Clinical Supply Agreement.

The Company evaluated this agreement under ASC 606 and identified one performance obligation under the agreement: to perform services related to manufacturing the commercial supply of retifanlimab. The transaction price is based on a fixed price per batch of bulk drug substance to be manufactured and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The transaction price will be recognized using the input method reflecting the costs incurred (including resources consumed and labor hours expended) related to the manufacturing services.  During the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $1.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for services performed under the Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement.

During 2019, the Company entered into two agreements under which the Company is to perform manufacturing services for Zai Lab’s clinical needs of margetuximab and tebotelimab (Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements).  The Company evaluated the agreements under ASC 606 and determined that they should be accounted for as a single contract and identified two performance obligations within that contract: to perform services related to manufacturing the clinical supply of each of margetuximab and tebotelimab.  The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to manufacture drug product and drug substance, and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date.  During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to the Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, related to the Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements.

The Company recognized revenue allocated to the other programs at a point in time upon transfer of the licenses to Zai Lab in June 2021. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $3.7 million and $18.1 million, respectively, under the 2021 Zai Lab Agreement.  As of

Products and services provided under long-term contracts represent a significant portion of sales in the Albany Engineered Composites segment and we account for these contracts using the percentage of completion (actual cost to estimated cost) method. That method requires significant judgment and estimation, which could be considerably different if the underlying circumstances were to change. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the period the change occurs. Changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts could be caused by increases or decreases in the contract value, revisions to customer delivery requirements, updated labor or overhead rates, factors affecting the supply chain, changes in the evaluation of contract risks and opportunities, or other factors. Changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts increased operating income by $2.1 million and $2.4 million for the three and nine month periods

The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at September 30, 2021 and 2020, is considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

This update requires certain convertible instruments to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.  Additionally, the update requires the use of the "if-converted" method, removing the treasury stock method, when calculating diluted shares.  The two methods of adoption are the full and modified retrospective approaches.  We expect to utilize the modified retrospective approach.  Using this approach, the guidance shall be applied to transactions outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendment is adopted.  The final rule is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We expect the adoption of this update will add approximately 17 million dilutive shares unless the additional shares under the if-converted method are anti-dilutive.  We expect to adopt the update at the required adoption date of January 1, 2022.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a
going concern. The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating
loss since inception of $10,428,812. The development of pharmaceuticals with the objective of obtaining approval by the FDA and other
international regulatory authorities is not a short-term endeavor for any specific drug candidate. It also requires extremely significant
amounts of capital funding for clinical trials and other matters. At September 30, 2021, the Company had negative working capital $39,986.
The Company will require significant additional capital to fund the implementation and execution of its business plan. This capital,
which likely will be millions of dollars for a single drug candidate, will be required for research, regulatory applications, and clinical
trials. At the present time, the Company does not have any commitments or known sources for this level of funding. These and other factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

During the course of preparing its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company identified an adjustment totaling $0.8 million related to activity in the prior periods. The adjustment relates primarily to a true up of certain revenue resulting from a change in the invoicing process with one of the Company’s customers and a difference of interpretation of an agreement with them. The error resulted in the Company’s revenue and net income being overstated by $0.4 million for the years prior to 2021, $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. As such, the basic EPS and diluted EPS were overstated for each of the first two quarters of 2021. Basic EPS would have decreased by $0.02 and diluted by $0.01 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 because of this adjustment. The impact would have decreased basic EPS and diluted EPS by $0.02 for the three months ended June 30, 2021.

The
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, with the consent of its stockholder, had elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of paying federal corporate income taxes, the stockholder(s) of an S Corporation are taxed individually
on their proportionate share of the Company’s taxable income. Therefore, prior to the business combination discussed above, the
Company had made no provision for income taxes. Effective with the business combination, the wholly-owned subsidiary became a C-corporation,
and the loss incurred in 2018 for the period as a C-corporation approximated $270,000. See Note 7. The Company’s income tax returns
are open for examination for up to the past six years under the statute of limitations. There are no tax returns currently under examination.

The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $392.2 million as of September 30, 2021 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company did not carry an income tax provision amount as the Company does not recognize tax benefits from current year tax losses in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  The Company’s tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $54.9 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions due to the valuation allowance.  At September 30, 2021, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to amortization of the Notes.  The Company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as future realization of such assets is not more likely than not to occur.

Farms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $33.7 million (64.1%) and $10.2 million (19.4%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster (such as an earthquake, wildfire, or flood) occur or climate change impact the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  None of our farms in California or Florida have been materially impacted by the recent wildfires or hurricanes that occurred in those respective regions.  In addition, in light of the ongoing drought taking place in the western U.S., all of our farms in the region have independent (and, in most cases, multiple) sources of water, in addition to rainfall, and have not been materially impacted by the current drought conditions.  No other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of our total lease revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data.

Prior to acquisition, Partsmaster leased parts washer machines to customers through its Torrents leasing program. The Torrents leasing program comprised a minor portion of the Partsmaster business. The Company will continue the leasing program for the foreseeable future. These leases are classified as operating leases. The leased machines are recognized as fixed assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and the leasing revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the leasing term. The Torrents machine leasing program generated $0.8 million and $2.2 million of revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The carrying value of the Torrents leasing assets as of September 30, 2021 is $1.0 million. The Company has adopted the practical expedient not to separate non-lease components that would be within the scope of ASC 606 from the associated lease components as the relevant criteria under ASC 842 are met.

Our income tax expense or benefit for interim periods has been historically determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that we could not make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate primarily due to nearly break-even pre-tax earnings. For example during the first quarter of 2021, the Company reported pre-tax losses of $572, second quarter pre-tax earnings of $549 and third quarter pre-tax losses of $310 while year-to-date pre-tax losses total $333. As a result, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was calculated based on 2021 year-to-date results.

In April 2020, the FASB issued a question-and-answer document (the “Lease Modification Q&A”) focused on the application of lease accounting guidance to lease concessions provided as a result of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. The Lease Modification Q&A clarifies that entities may elect not to evaluate whether lease-related relief provided to mitigate the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is a lease modification under Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). Instead, an entity that elects not to evaluate whether a concession directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which does not substantially increase either its rights as lessor or the obligations of the tenant, is a lease modification can decide whether or not to apply the modification guidance. An entity should apply the election consistently to leases with similar characteristics and similar circumstances. NHI has elected not to apply the modification guidance under ASC 842 and has accounted for qualified rent concessions as variable lease payments when applicable, recorded as rental income when received. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we provided $5.8 million and $19.9 million, respectively, in lease concessions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed in more detail in Note 7.

Upon completion of the sale, Bickford satisfied the terms of our prior agreement that contingently waived $2.1 million in rental income for the third quarter of 2020. These properties were part of our ongoing negotiations for the sale to Bickford of nine properties being leased to Bickford. We continue to explore our options for the remaining three properties, which could include a sale to a third party, re-tenanting, or retaining the existing lease with Bickford. Reference Note 7 for discussion of additional contingent consideration associated with this disposition that was not included in the transaction price at the time of closing.

In addition to the concessions noted above, we have agreed with Bickford to defer $4.5 million in contractual rent due for the fourth quarter of 2021 and expect to grant up to $4.0 million in deferrals in the first quarter of 2022. We have also reached agreement with two other tenants regarding additional rent deferrals of approximately $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. We agreed with Holiday to utilize $0.6 million of the lease deposit towards July 2021 contractual rent. The balance of the lease deposit at September 30, 2021 was $8.8 million. Reference Note 2 for discussion of additional Holiday contractual rent activity.

In the three months ended October 3, 2021, our income tax benefit of $2.2 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $86.5 million was primarily due to the deferred taxes on mark-to-market unrealized losses on equity investments. Our income tax provision of $36.7 million in the three months ended September 27, 2020 on a profit from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $146.4 million was primarily due to associated domestic tax expenses arising from the taxable gain related to the Spin-Off, and foreign withholding taxes from foreign dividend distributions.

---

In the nine months ended October 3, 2021, our income tax benefit of $5.0 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $64.0 million was primarily due to windfall benefits from stock-based compensation deduction and the true-up of estimated state tax liability. Our income tax provision of $38.7 million in the nine months ended September 27, 2020 on a profit from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $223.1 million was primarily due to domestic tax expense arising from the taxable gain related to the Spin-Off, and foreign withholding taxes from foreign dividend distributions.

During the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of  $4 million and $20 million, respectively, which reflects income tax expense in countries where the Company is profitable; accrued withholding taxes; ongoing assessments related to the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits; the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and/or recognize expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions (including the U.S.) due to valuation allowances; and other non-recurring tax items, including enacted tax law changes. Pretax losses in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $48 million and $106 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate in those years.

the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

2.0 and $0.2 million respectively through the nine months ended September
2021. The non-cash transaction was supported by a valuation conducted by an independent investment bank. This transaction is not considered
a significant acquisition as defined per Rule 1-02 (W) of Regulation S-X, and will be accounted for as a common control acquisition under
ASC 805. This calls for financial information for prior periods to be retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information indicating
that financial data of previously separate entities are combined.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 7,767,874 and 7,575,168 common shares held in a grantor trust as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and
discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021,
we incurred a net loss of $3,745,169, had a working capital deficit of $3,938,170 and had an accumulated deficit of $15,066,663 at September

or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations as they
come due. There is no assurance that these events will be satisfactorily completed. As a result, there is doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance date of these financial statements

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States (“GAAP”), which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company is subject
to a number of risks similar to those of earlier stage commercial companies, including dependence on key individuals and products, the
difficulties inherent in the development of a commercial market, the potential need to obtain additional capital, competition from larger
companies, other technology companies and other technologies. The Company has a limited operating history and the sales and income potential
of its business and market are unproven. The Company incurred net losses of $12,002,075

The
Company is a lessor for certain office space leased by the Company and sub-leased to others under non-cancelable leases. These lease
agreements provide for a fixed base rent and are currently on a month by month basis. All leases are considered operating leases. There
are no rights to purchase the premises and no residual value guarantees. For the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the
Company received lease income of $9,155 and $8,624, respectively.

The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of RMS. Accordingly, the pro forma results above are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated, nor are the pro forma results indicative of results which may occur in the future. The RMS results included in the above have been converted to U.S. GAAP from IFRS as issued by the IASB and have been translated to USD at rates in effect for the periods presented. The RMS amounts in the pro forma results include an addition to revenue  of approximately $3 million and a reduction to revenue of approximately $21 million relating to a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue required as part of acquisition accounting for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-7, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715).” Under the new guidance, employers are required to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same statement of operations caption as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. Employers are required to present the other components of the net periodic benefit cost separately from the caption that includes the service costs and outside of any subtotal of operating profit and are required to disclose the caption used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost, if not presented separately on the statement of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2017-7 effective in the second quarter of 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the Company’s historically reported net income (loss) but resulted in a presentation reclassification which increased the Company’s historically reported operating profit by $0.1 million for the six months ended June 25, 2020.

---

In addition, the Company had a loss from operations of $38.7 million and cash used in operating activities of $34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. These factors, combined with the Company's forecast of cash required to fund operations for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The future viability of the Company beyond one year from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds when needed, it may be required to implement cost reduction strategies, including ceasing development of GEN-011 or other research programs and activities, including the Inhibigens and COVID-19 programs. Genocea expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, strategic transactions, or other sources of funding, including utilization of the Lincoln Park Capital (“LPC”) purchase agreement and the at-the-market (“ATM”) equity offering program with Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen"). Although management plans to pursue additional funding, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, or at all.

In determining the most appropriate reportable segments, we consider operating segments’ economic and other characteristics, including home floor plans, average selling prices, gross margin percentage, geographical proximity, production construction processes, suppliers, subcontractors, regulatory environments, customer type and underlying demand and supply. Each operating segment follows the same accounting policies and is managed by our management team. We have no inter-segment sales, as all sales are to external customers. Operating results for each segment may not be indicative of the results for such segment had it been an independent, stand-alone entity for the periods presented.

The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, using a modified retrospective approach. Effective January 1, 2021, the dilutive effect of the Company’s convertible and exchangeable notes is calculated using the if-converted method. Prior to the adoption, the dilutive effect of the convertible and exchangeable notes was calculated using the treasury stock method. In September 2021, in accordance with the indenture for the convertible senior notes due in March 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”), the Company irrevocably elected “combination settlement” with a specified dollar amount equal to $1,750 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes for all conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes that occur on or after September 15, 2021, the free conversion date, which effectively will result in an all cash settlement for the 2022 Convertible Notes so long as the stock price is less than $79.74 at the time of conversion. As a result, the 2022 Convertible Notes were only dilutive prior to September 15, 2021. All of the Company’s other convertible and exchangeable notes require net share settlement, using the if-converted method results in a similar dilutive effect as using the treasury stock method under the previous accounting standard, due to the fact that only in-the-money shares are included in the dilutive effect. The Company had 0.7 million and 0.3 million shares of dilutive effect from its convertible and exchangeable notes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021.

All outstanding stock awards were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share in the three-month and nine-month fiscal periods ended October 2, 2020 because their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations. For the three-month and nine-month fiscal periods ended October 2, 2020, respectively, an additional 15,574 and 34,288 shares issuable under equity awards, which would have been dilutive if exercised based on the average market price being higher than the exercise price, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations.

The
accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no current or historical
revenues, has incurred net losses of $32,290 and net income of $5,299 during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 and $91,836

$444,912 as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and has experienced negative cash flows from operations. These circumstances
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the year following the sate the condensed
financial statements were available to be issued. The accompanying condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

On
March 11, 2015, Powerdyne International, Inc. (the “Company”) finalized its negotiations with Farmacia Brisas del Mar, a
corporation organized under the laws of Puerto Rico (the “Lessee”), and the Company and the Lessee have entered into a five-year
contract to lease power generating equipment to Lessee based upon power consumption. In addition, the custom designed system will also
provide cogeneration capabilities with the addition of chillers to support the air conditioning demands. The agreement provides for a
payment to the Company of a monthly fee equal to the greater of a set monthly base rate or a monthly base rate plus an additional amount
based on kilowatt wattage. The agreement provides for termination by the Company only in the event of nonperformance by the Lessee unless
Lessee pays all payments due for the remainder of the term. The agreement contains representation and warranties, default provisions
and indemnification provisions typical for agreements of this type. In 2016 the terms on the Farmacia Del Mar lease was modified to a
monthly payment, based on actual power consumption. The total revenue-to date derived from this lease is $1,240.

Basic earnings per share of common stock are computed by dividing net earnings available to each class of common stockholders on an as if distributed basis by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share, by definition, reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock, that then shared in the distributed earnings of each class of common stock. U.S. GAAP requires a two-class presentation for the Company's two classes of common stock. The Company currently has no share-based compensation awards outstanding that could be redeemed for shares of common stock.

Our effective income tax rate decreased in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. The lower effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 is primarily attributable to the recognition of a tax benefit of $125 million, primarily from a non-cash impairment in 2020. This tax benefit on our $11 million of pre-tax loss for the third quarter of 2020 resulted in an abnormally high effective tax rate.

The Company is devoting most of its efforts to the sales and marketing and research and development of its test kits.

Aon intends to work diligently with all antitrust agencies concerned to ensure they can carry out their work as efficiently as possible. At this time, in light of the uncertainties and many variables involved, Aon cannot estimate the ultimate impact on our company from these investigations or any related private litigation, nor any damages, penalties, or fines related to them.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company generated
a net loss of $66,367 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 and had a stockholders’ deficit of $1,135,062 as of September
30, 2021. These conditions, among others, raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on working capital advances being provided by the Company’s majority
shareholder for its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is no assurance
that the working capital advances will continue in the future nor that Company will be successful in raising additional funds through
other sources. The Company’s plan to alleviate the going concern issue is to continue to seek out a merger partner which has the
financial resources to address the going concern question.

The Company does not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by reportable segment. Accordingly, assets are not reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of segment performance or in making decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, as applicable, were based on 5.7 million and 4.9 million of such awards, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, as applicable, were based on 5.9 million and 5.0 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

The decrease in Operating profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was mainly due to sales deleveraging as well as lapping the impact of a $239 million gain from the re-measurement of our previously held equity interest in Suzhou KFC in the third quarter of 2020 upon the acquisition, which is further described below. The decrease in Operating profit for the year to date ended September 30, 2021 was mainly due to lapping the re-measurement gain related to Suzhou KFC, offset by same-store sales growth.

Our
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. While this
would make it our third profitable quarter in a row, we still operate limited ongoing business operations that generate income. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we reported net income of $79,734 and $946,676 respectively, and an accumulated deficit
of $18,541,562 as of September 30, 2021. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to (a) continue to run our current businesses profitably, (b) raise additional debt,
or (c) equity funding to meet our ongoing operating expenses and ultimately in merging with another entity with experienced management
and profitable operations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in achieving these objectives.

The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2021 of $10 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $103 million. The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2020 of $15 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $67 million. The increased income tax provision for the current period was largely the result of an increase in the amount and relative mix of pretax income across several jurisdictions. This was partially offset by discrete tax benefits recognized in the quarter relating to equity compensation deductions and to a lesser extent non U.S. tax credits claimed on an amended U.S. federal income tax return filing. The prior-year quarter income tax benefit was largely driven by the recognition of additional non U.S. tax credits claimed on an amended U.S. federal income tax filing. The provision/benefit for income taxes in each of these periods was also impacted by the relative amount and mix of permanent tax adjustments included in the income tax computation and other discrete tax items recognized in the periods.

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $3,000 and $4,000, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 and $12,000 and $15,000, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

Nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and redeemable limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, there were 27,000 and 45,000 nonvested shares, respectively, of our restricted common stock outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during these periods.

The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities, and manufacturing  products for use in food, beverages, feed, energy, and industrial applications, and ingredients and solutions for human and animal nutrition.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less.  The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606.  The Company recognized revenue from transportation service contracts of $606 million, $423 million, and $515 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20.

Treasury shares have been excluded from average outstanding shares from the date of acquisition. The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding includes the impact of 7,728,466 common shares held in a grantor trust. The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. The difference in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is attributable entirely to the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation plans. Changes in shares of common stock outstanding, net of treasury shares, are presented below. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding do not include shares related to unissued restricted stock units (including shares held in the grantor trust).

In general, it is Snap-on’s practice and intention to reinvest certain earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of 2021 year end, the company has not made a provision for incremental U.S. income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $358.7 million of such undistributed earnings that is deemed indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.  As a result of the Tax Act, which subjected the majority of the company’s undistributed foreign earnings to taxation for the 2017 tax year, the company can now repatriate non-U.S. cash in a tax efficient manner.  Accordingly, the company has reversed its prior assertion concerning the indefinite reinvestment of the majority of its undistributed foreign earnings and has recorded a deferred tax liability of $4.4 million for the incremental tax costs associated with the future potential repatriation of such earnings.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares of common stock. These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, are considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested shares of our restricted stock do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Vested RSUs (for which shares of common stock have not yet been delivered) are included in the calculations of basic net loss per share. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

The accounting policies of each segment are the same as those followed by the company as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are priced as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Accordingly, the ECS segment records intersegment revenue and manufacturing profit on hardware and software shipments to customers under contracts of other segments. These segments, in turn, record customer revenue and marketing profits on such shipments of company hardware and software to customers.  In the company’s consolidated statements of income (loss), the manufacturing costs of products sourced from the ECS segment and sold to other segments’ customers are reported in cost of revenue for these other segments. Also included in the ECS segment’s sales and gross profit are sales of hardware and software sold to other segments for internal use in their engagements. The amount of such profit included in gross profit of the ECS segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1.4 million, $7.8 million and $5.7 million, respectively. The sales and profit on these transactions is eliminated in Corporate.

On a periodic basis, we assess our Corporate cost allocation estimates. Our prior year assessment resulted in increases in Corporate cost allocations to both our homebuilding and financial services segments beginning January 1, 2020, to reflect the use of centralized administrative functions.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as applicable, were based on 5.8 million, 4.9 million and 4.6 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

Brighthouse Services currently provides the Company certain services which include, but are not limited to, treasury, financial planning and analysis, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting and information technology. When specific identification to a particular legal entity and/or product is not practicable, an allocation methodology based on various performance measures or activity-based costing, such as sales, new policies/contracts issued, reserves, and in-force policy counts is used. The bases for such charges are modified and adjusted by management when necessary or appropriate to reflect fairly and equitably the actual incidence of cost incurred by the Company and/or affiliate. Management believes that the methods used to allocate expenses under these arrangements are reasonable. Revenues received from an affiliate related to these agreements, recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees, were $13 million, $11 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

In accordance with its policy, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that the actual lives of certain developed technology were shorter than the estimated useful lives used for amortization purposes in the Company's financial statements. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, the Company changed its estimates of the useful lives of certain developed technology to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The remaining useful life of certain developed technology that was 3.25 years at January 1, 2021 was reduced to 2 years, while the remaining useful life of certain developed technology that was 4.25 years was reduced to 3 years. The effect of this change was to increase 2021 amortization expense by approximately $1.0 million and decrease 2021 net income and basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.8 million and $0.06, respectively.

The
tax effected aggregate Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) was $7.2 million and $3.4 million in tax year 2021 and 2020, which

The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to undertake further exploration
and development activities and ultimately generating profitable operations from its oil and natural gas interests in the future. The
Company’s current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of its current assets to meet its current expenditure requirements
and the accuracy of management’s estimates of those requirements. Should those estimates be materially incorrect, the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern may be impaired. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. During the year ended December
31, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $10.7 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $223.5 million.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

As
of December 31, 2021, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by Commlabs India of approximately $0.9 million. Because
all of these earnings have previously been subject to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act of 2017, any additional taxes due with respect to such earnings or the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax
basis of the Company’s foreign investments would generally be limited to foreign and state taxes. The Company intends, however,
to indefinitely reinvest these earnings and expects future U.S. cash generation to be sufficient to meet future U.S. cash needs.

The license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, event-based milestone payments, sales-based royalty payments, or some combination of these. The event-based milestone payments represent variable consideration and we use the most likely amount method to estimate this variable consideration. Given the high degree of uncertainly around the achievement of these milestones, we do not recognize revenue from these milestone payments until the uncertainty associated with these payments is resolved. We currently estimate variable consideration related to milestone payments to be zero and, as such, no revenue has been recognized for milestone payments. We recognize revenue from sales-based royalty payments when or as the sales occur. On a quarterly basis, we re-evaluate our estimate of milestone variable consideration to determine whether any amount should be included in the transaction price and recorded in revenue prospectively.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of December 31, 2021, will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of therapeutic product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development, and clinical manufacturing of its therapeutic product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $92,166 and, as of December 31, 2021, had an accumulated deficit of $1,915,556. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development, adequately satisfy or renegotiate long-term debt obligations, obtain regulatory approval of its therapeutics product candidates, successfully commercialize its therapeutics product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

". This adoption also reduced non-cash interest expense starting in 2021 due to the removal of the accretion of the debt discount on the 2024 Notes.

Net income (loss) of foreign subsidiaries was $3.7 million, $(55.7) million, and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Generally, it has been the Company's practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As previously noted, the Tax Act made significant changes to the taxation of undistributed earnings, requiring that all previously untaxed earnings and profits of the Company's controlled foreign operations be subjected to the transition tax. Since these earnings have now been subjected to U.S. federal tax, they would only be potentially subject to limited other taxes, including foreign withholding and certain state taxes. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for foreign withholdings and state taxes on its undistributed international earnings or losses of its foreign subsidiaries since it intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the United States. The Company has estimated that the amount of the unrecorded deferred tax liability related to undistributed international earnings is approximately $1.5 million.

In addition, the Company had a loss from operations of $52.1 million and used $45.4 million of cash for operating activities during 2021. These factors, combined with the Company's forecast of cash required to fund operations for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The future viability of the Company beyond one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds when needed, it may be required to implement cost reduction strategies, including ceasing development of GEN-011 or the Inhibigens program. Genocea expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, strategic transactions, or other sources of funding, including utilization of the at-the-market (“ATM”) equity offering program with Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen"). Although management plans to pursue additional funding, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, or at all.

In accordance with the Company’s policies of determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and accounting for earnings per share, the net income (loss) per common share is adjusted for earnings distributed through declared dividends (if any) and allocated to all participating securities (weighted average common shares outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding) under the two-class method. Under this method, allocations were made to 245,075, 341,673 and 402,380 of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Participating securities are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method if the impact is more dilutive than the two-class method. Other potentially dilutive shares of common stock from the Company’s performance units and forward sales agreements are considered when calculating diluted earnings per share.

During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company identified an error related to its calculation of net loss attributable to the common stockholders.
The Company determined that in the prior period reported, these amounts were improperly calculated. This error did not affect net income,
assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, cash flows from financing activities or the net increase or decrease in cash and cash
equivalents for the period. In accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, “Materiality,” and SAB No.
108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,”
we evaluated the materiality of the error from qualitative and quantitative perspectives and concluded that the error was immaterial
to the current and prior periods mentioned above. Consequently, the net loss per share – basic attributable to common stockholders
of OmniQ Corp contained in these financial statements have been restated for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change resulted in
an additional net loss after series C dividend attributable to common stockholders’ of OmniQ Corp $382

Management
does not expect existing cash as of December 31, 2021 or as of March 31, 2022 to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations
for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis which assumes the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company has incurred losses totaling $14.2 million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue
from operations, and will require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing
to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to
finance operating costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital
through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable
terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

products and raising additional capital through sales of equity or debt securities as may be necessary to pursue its business plans and
sustain operations until such time as the Company can achieve profitability. Management believes that aggressive marketing combined with
additional financing as necessary will result in improved operations and cash flow in 2022 and beyond. However, there can be no assurance
that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Farms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $49.6 million (65.9%) and $13.7 million (18.2%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster (such as an earthquake, wildfire, or flood) occur or climactic change impact the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  None of our farms in California or Florida have been materially impacted by the recent wildfires, droughts, or hurricanes that occurred in those respective regions.  In addition, in light of the ongoing drought taking place in the western U.S., all of our farms in the region have independent (and, in most cases, multiple) sources of water, in addition to rainfall, and have not been materially impacted by the current drought conditions.  No other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of the total rental revenue recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.

The Company determined it has a variable interest through its ground lease at its Beachwood, Ohio property (The Vue Apartments) and the owner/operator is a VIE because its equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company further determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because the Company does not have power over the activities that most significantly impact the owner/operator’s economic performance and therefore, does not consolidate this VIE for financial statement purposes.  Accordingly, the Company accounts for this investment as land and the revenues from the ground lease as Rental income, net. The ground lease provides for rent which can be deferred and paid based on the operating performance of the property; therefore, this rent is recognized as rental income when the operating performance is achieved and the rent is received. Ground lease rental income amounted to $0, $729,000 and $1,597,000 during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Following the closing of a qualified financing (as such term is defined in the Abbisko Agreement), Abbisko was required to pay the Company a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable financial milestone payment of $3.0 million. Abbisko achieved such qualified financing in March 2020 and, as a result, the Company was eligible to receive the milestone payment, which was received by the Company in April 2020. The Company is also eligible to receive potential development and regulatory milestone payments, which vary based on the number of indications developed, and potential commercial milestone payments based on annual net sales of mavorixafor-based licensed products.

---

Upon entering into the Abbisko Agreement, the Company evaluated the Abbisko Agreement under ASC 606 and determined the Abbisko Agreement contained a single performance obligation related to the exclusive license to develop and commercialize mavorixafor and the transfer of know-how that was satisfied at the inception of the arrangement. The transaction price related to the transfer of the license and know-how was fully constrained and the Company ascribed no transaction price to the development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the “most-likely amount” method. The Company concluded that any consideration related to the initial transfer of the license and know-how will be recognized when it is probable that Abbisko will achieve the related financial milestone and other operational milestones. Any consideration related to sales-based milestones (including royalties) will be recognized when the related sales occur as these amounts have been determined to relate predominantly to the license granted to Abbisko and therefore are recognized at the later of when the performance obligation is satisfied or the related sales occur. As a result of Abbisko’s achievement of the qualified financing, the Company reversed the constraint related to this milestone and recognized $3.0 million of license revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.

During the first quarter of 2020, the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by the OPEC+ countries caused oil and gas commodity demand to decrease significantly. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the current regulatory environment, depressed oil and gas commodity price and demand and the resulting 30% decrease in average active United States oil rig count during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, which is historically our largest revenue quarter, led to a slight decrease in revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended  December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company incurred a loss from operations of approximately $11.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 2021. The Company determined that these were triggering events which could indicate impairment of its long-lived assets during the fourth quarter of 2021 as revenue didn't rebound as expediently as expected. The Company reviewed both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business during the analysis of impairment. During the quantitative review, the Company reviewed its undiscounted future cash flows in its assessment of whether long-lived assets were impaired.

The
Company reported net income of approximately $0.2 million and used cash in operating activities of approximately $2.0 million for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The current Intercreditor Revolving Credit Facility with Crestmark Bank is under an evergreen arrangement
that terminates upon written notice by the Company and is subject to a termination fee if terminated by the Company anytime other than
the annual renewal date of June 11. Our credit facility with Iron Horse Credit that was to expire on June 11, 2022, however absent any
termination notice given by the Company to IHC, was automatically renewed for another twelve-month term and is subject to a termination
fee if terminated by the Company prior to the twelve-month renewal date. The Company believes that our cash on hand, working capital
(net of cash), cash expected to be generated from our operating forecast, along with the availability of cash from our credit facilities
(See Note 6 – BANK FINANCING) will be adequate to meet the Company’s liquidity requirements for at least twelve months from
the filing of this report.

As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements during the year ended March
31,2021, the Company incurred a loss from continuing operations of $45,972 and used cash in operating activities - continuing
operations of $24,733, and at March 31, 2021, the Company had a stockholders’ deficit of $51,356
and an accumulated deficit of $684,659.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date
that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the
Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the
Company as a going concern. The Company had a net loss of $1,361,021 for its most recent fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. As of July
31, 2022, the Company has minimal cash and a significant working capital deficit. We have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit,
have negative working capital and have not generated cash from our operations to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. It is
management’s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $182,903
and $297,755,
respectively, for the years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company used cash in operations of $126,055 in fiscal 2022.
Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,291,567
at May 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period
of 12 months from the issuance date of this report. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the
Company’s ability to implement its business plan, raise capital, and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s
cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a
private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and
generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

The
Company incurred a loss of $9,929 for the year ended June 30, 2022 (2021- $4,390 and 2020 - $4,001) and had an accumulated deficit
of $109,005 as of June 30, 2022. As a development stage issuer, the Company has not yet commenced its mining operations and accordingly
does not generate any revenue. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had cash of $5,280 which may not be sufficient to fund normal
operations for the next twelve months without deferring payment on certain liabilities or raising additional funds. In addition,
the Company will be required to raise additional funds for construction and commencement of operations. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

At June 30, 2017, and prior to this date, the Company had estimated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. For the periods prior to the year ending June 30, 2017, the Company is unable to accurately verify or compute the applicable federal and state net operating losses. The Company’s tax year end was on a calendar year end December 31. Such losses may not be utilizable or possibly eliminated under IRC Section 382/383, change of ownership rules. Management is in the process of reviewing IRC Section 382/383 at the time of this filing for the period indicated.  The federal net operating loss for the period ending June 30, 2021, is estimated to be approximately $20.6 million and for state $6.3 million. The federal net operating loss for the period ending June 30, 2022, is estimated to be approximately $37.8 million and for state $13.1 million. These carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation under I.R.C. §§ 382 and 383 and similar state provisions, if the Company experienced one or more ownership changes which would limit the amount of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by

There is a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") of subsidiaries of US parents. This new tax law is based on the excess of foreign income over a specified return (deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporation). This will result in a US tax on foreign earnings where: (i) there is not a large aggregate foreign fixed asset base; and (ii) foreign earnings are taxed at a low rate. For ASC 740 (Accounting for Income Tax), it is acceptable to recognize the GILTI in the year in which it is included on the tax return on the basis that it is triggered by the existence, on an aggregate basis, of "excess" low-taxed foreign income in that year. For IFRS tax accounting and GAAP, it is acceptable to recognize the charge for GILTI in the year in which it is included on the tax return on the basis that it is triggered by the existence, on an aggregate basis, of "excess" low-taxed foreign income in that year. Since the Mission foreign subsidiaries for the year ending June 30, 2022, recorded an operating loss of approximately $7.4 million.  There is no current GILTI tax recorded as a period cost. The Company is in the process of reviewing GILTI, as it is computed on a cumulative basis, as it relates to United States Repatriation Tax, as well as GILTI.

The Arena License Agreements provide that license fees are not required to be paid by MSG Sports during periods when The Garden is unavailable for use due to a force majeure event. As a result of government-mandated suspension of events at The Garden beginning on March 13, 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Garden was not available for use by MSG Sports from the effective date of the Arena License Agreements through the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2021, and, accordingly, the Company did not record any operating lease revenue for this arrangement during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2021. Use of The Garden resumed for Knicks and Rangers home games without fans in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively, and was available at 10% seating capacity from February through May 2021 when it became available at 100% seating capacity.

NCI of Unicorns as of March 31, 2021 was negative $745 thousand which consisted 100% of the loss for the first quarter of 2021. On the
acquisition date the NCI increased by $2.5 thousand which represents 33.33% of the $7.5 thousand par value of the Unicorns common stock.
The Unicorns net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $12,336 thousand of which $4,608 thousand related to the NCI resulting

As
of the acquisition date the fair value of the NCI of the net assets acquired was approximately $3,730 thousand. Based on ASC 810, we
utilized the Guideline Public Company Method that uses business enterprise value multiples from data on comparable public companies.
The selected multiple used to calculate the fair value of ITSQuest NCI was based on several considerations such as the growth prospects
of the Company. The Company used a .60 multiple and a .50 multiple to calculate the estimated enterprise value to determine the fair
value of the noncontrolling interest. These multiples were below the median of the range of multiples used as part of the valuation,
which spans from 0.14 to 8.50. Additionally, a 10% control premium was applied to reflect the impact on the asking price for a controlling
interest in the Company based on management’s judgement. The ITSQuest net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was
$204 thousand and $103 thousand, respectively. The NCI portion of such losses was $100 thousand and $50 thousand for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the NCI balance was $3,579 thousand and $3,680 thousand as of December 31, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

Since our contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. In addition, changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We recorded changes to project estimates that unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $30 and $19 in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in estimates favorably impacted operating income by approximately $7 in fiscal year 2020. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial
statements, we had a net loss of $45,325 and $36,415 for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The working capital
deficit was $350,698 as of August 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow
positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. The Company is seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity
financings to fund its operations in the future. Although the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity, from related
party working capital advances, and from the issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to
do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that
the Company will need to curtail its operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.

Businesses
and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early
December 2022. The number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to increase greatly which may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities. Construction of our Smart Kiosks may not be
immediate, which impacts our plan of enhancing our face-to-face customer services and increasing our market share. The Company
continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care and
health related household products on its new online platform, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022, to mitigate the
adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also follows up closely with the local governmental agencies regarding its applications for
construction permits for Smart Kiosks. However, as the pandemic increased overall public health consciousness in the PRC, the
Company’s average monthly online sale revenue increased by $0.2
million, or 34.4%,
from $0.4 million for the year
ended September 30, 2021 to $0.6 million

use of ADXS31-164, also known as ADXS-HER2, for evaluation in the treatment of osteosarcoma in humans. Under the terms of the license
agreement, as amended, OST will be responsible for the conduct and funding of a clinical study evaluating ADXS-HER2 in recurrent, completely
resected osteosarcoma. Under the most recent amendment to the licensing agreement, OST agreed to pay Advaxis $25,000 per month (“Monthly
Payment”) starting on April 30, 2020 until it achieved its funding milestone of $2,337,500. Upon receipt of the first Monthly Payment,
Advaxis initiated the transfer of the intellectual property and licensing rights of ADXS31-164, which were licensed pursuant to the Penn
Agreement, back to the University of Pennsylvania. Contemporaneously, OST will enter negotiations with the University of Pennsylvania
to establish a licensing agreement for ADXS31-164 to OST for clinical and commercial development of the ADXS31-164 technology.

Basic net income (loss) per share represents
net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. As a result of the net loss
for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, diluted weighted average shares outstanding are the same as basic weighted average
shares outstanding, and do not include the potential common shares from stock options or unearned performance stock units because to
do so would be antidilutive. For the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, approximately 499,000 and 527,000 respectively, of
potential common shares (“in the money options”) and unvested performance stock units were excluded from the calculation
of diluted (loss) per share. For the three and six months ended January 31, 2021, approximately 47,000 and 23,000 weighted average stock
options and unvested performance stock units were included in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

significant number of our warrants outstanding through August 26, 2021 were participating securities, which shared dividend distributions
and the allocation of any undistributed earnings (deemed dividends) with our common shareholders. Since the warrants expired in accordance

For the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company incurred net losses of $58.6 million and $32.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $81.9 million and its accumulated deficit was $849.6 million. As a result of the Company's decision to terminate its license agreement with Oxford Biomedica (UK) Ltd. ("Oxford") to develop and commercialize AXO-Lenti-PD gene therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (the "Oxford Agreement") that is expected to become effective by March 31, 2022 (see Note 3(B) and Note 10), the Company estimates that its current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to support operations into the second half of calendar year 2023, including beyond the expected dates of major upcoming milestones for the Company's AXO-AAV-GM1 and AXO-AAV-GM2 gene therapy programs. As such, the Company has determined that there is no longer substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for the one-year period following the date that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes were issued. These estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects.

the SBA that the loan had been forgiven in its entirety. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, a gain of approximately $448,000
(including principal and interest) from the forgiveness of the loan was included in other income and expenses in the accompanying condensed

During
the first quarter of 2022, the restrictions, quarantines and closures remained in certain affected areas and government agencies in the
PRC. The approval process of our applications for the construction permits of smart kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies
and the construction project of smart kiosks was also postponed. The Company continues to focus its business through its online platform,
King Eagle Mall, to mitigate the adverse impacts by COVID-19 and follows up closely with the local governmental agencies for the application
for the construction permits of smart kiosks. In fact, the pandemic increased the overall public health consciousness in the PRC and
the Company experienced a significant growth in its average monthly online sale revenue by $1.4 million or 755.2% from $0.2 million for
the three months ended December 31, 2020 to $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.

The
Company has Federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $4,000,000 and state NOL carryforwards of approximately
$1,800,000. With the changes instituted by the CARES Act, the Federal NOLs have an indefinite life and will not expire. The Company’s
federal and state tax returns for the 2018 and 2019 tax years generally remain subject to examination by U.S. and various state authorities.
A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. After evaluation of the evidence, management determined that
a valuation allowance of approximately $1,256,059 for the year ended on October 31, 2021, and the fiscal three month period ended January
31, 2022, is necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized pursuant to ASC 740.

The Company accounts for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. In valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates use Level 3 inputs, including future expected cash flows and discount rates. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments arising from new facts and circumstances are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The results of operations of acquisitions are reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. The Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 included $150.1 million of net sales and $3.5 million of net income from acquisitions made in fiscal 2022.

deficit of $231,245. As an exploration stage entity, the Company has not yet commenced its mining operations and accordingly

can begin to generate net profit and raise adequate financing.

ended December 31, 2021 and has working capital and stockholder deficit of approximately $80,000 at December 31, 2021. The foregoing
raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance
date of this report. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification
of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to implement its business plan and continue as a going concern.
The Company is actively seeking investor funding.

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficits of $1,267,906 and $1,255,841 as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, and net losses of $12,065 and $26,468, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. The Company currently has business activities to generate funds for its own operations, however, has not yet achieved profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $18 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $115 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2020 of $21 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $109 million. The decrease in income tax provision relative to the prior-year period was largely the result of a shift in pretax income in international tax jurisdictions with favorable tax rates. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix, changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, special items, certain equity related compensation, and other discrete tax items that may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2021 of $28 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $218 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2020 of $5 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $176 million. The increase in the provision relative to the prior-year period was the result of a decrease in non-U.S. tax credits claimed on an amended U.S. federal income tax filing compared to the prior-year period. The provision for income taxes in each of these periods was also impacted by the relative amount and mix of permanent tax adjustments included in the income tax computation and other discrete tax items recognized in the periods.

Our income tax provisions are primarily driven by income in certain jurisdictions, deemed profit countries and withholding taxes on intercompany and third-party transactions that do not directly correlate to ordinary income or loss and other adjustments. Impairments and other charges recognized do not result in significant tax benefit due to our inability to forecast realization of the tax benefit of such losses.

In April 2017, the FCA announced an investigation relating to suspected competition law breaches in the aviation and aerospace broking industry, which, for Aon in 2016, represented less than $100 million in global revenue. The European Commission assumed jurisdiction over the investigation in place of the FCA, and the European Commission has now closed its investigation. Other antitrust agencies outside the E.U. are conducting formal or informal investigations regarding these matters. Aon intends to work diligently with all antitrust agencies concerned to ensure they can carry out their work as efficiently as possible. At this time, in light of the uncertainties and many variables involved, Aon cannot estimate the ultimate impact on our company from these investigations or any related private litigation, nor any damages, penalties, or fines related to them.

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize
a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset
for the lease term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The new guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures related
to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB amended the new lease standard which,
among other changes, allows a company to elect to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a transition option whereby a cumulative effect adjustment
is recorded to the opening balance of its retained earnings on the adoption date. The Company has elected to use this modified retrospective
transition option and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.5 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2022.
The Company also elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease
classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. The adoption of ASU
2016-02 resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities of $13.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively.
The standard did not have a significant effect on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss and Cash Flows. See Note
4 for additional lease disclosures.

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $69,167,693 as of March 31, 2022
and total stockholders’ deficit of $946,420. For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,052,354
as compared to a net loss in the amount of $691,495 during the same period ended March 31, 2021. These factors as well as the uncertain
conditions that the Company faces in its day-to-day operations with respect to cash flows create an uncertainty as to the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. Management has taken action to strengthen the Company’s working capital position and
generate sufficient cash to meet its operating needs through June 30, 2022 and beyond.

During the three month period ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of $8 million which reflects income tax expense in countries where the Company is profitable, accrued withholding taxes, and the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and/or recognize expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions, including the United States ("U.S."), due to valuation allowances. Pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $10 million and $11 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate in those years.

The
Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. For the three months ended March
31, 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $3.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $24.3 million and does not expect to generate
positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to incur significant and increasing losses until regulatory
approval is granted for its first product candidate, RenovoGem™. Regulatory approval is not guaranteed and may never be obtained.
The Company may seek to raise additional capital through debt financings, private or public equity financings, license agreements, collaborative
agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources of financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will
be available or will be at terms acceptable to the Company. The inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact
on the Company’s financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company will need to generate significant
revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so.

Potentially dilutive common shares would include common shares that would be outstanding if Notes convertible at the balance sheet date were converted.  As discussed in Note 10, Convertible Notes, upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company’s election.  The initial conversion rate of the Notes is 32.3428 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes.  As of March 31, 2022, no Notes were convertible pursuant to the original terms.  After giving effect for the Exchanged Principal, the total principal amount of the Notes and New Notes outstanding as of March 31, 2022 was $118.8 million.  The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and New Notes based on the initial conversion rate was approximately 3.8 million shares as of March 31, 2022.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company did not carry an income tax provision amount as the Company does not recognize tax benefits from current year tax losses in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  The Company’s tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $14.2 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions due to the valuation allowance.  At March 31, 2022, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to amortization of the Notes.  The Company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as future realization of such assets is not more likely than not to occur.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 11,592,699 and 11,651,811 common shares held in a grantor trust as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.

For the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the average market price of the company's common stock exceeded the exercise price of the Convertible Notes (as defined below) resulting in 1,688,402 and 744,334 diluted common stock equivalents to be included in the diluted net earnings per share, respectively. There have been no conversions to date. See Note 12, Financing Arrangements for further details on the Convertible Notes. There were no anti-dilutive restricted stock grants excluded from common stock equivalents in any period presented.

The Company has incurred net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $262.2 million as of March 31, 2022. Net losses and negative cash flows from operations have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders’ equity and working capital. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years.

As part of its annual assessment of gift card breakage and during the sixteen weeks ended April 17, 2022, the Company re-evaluated the estimated redemption pattern related to gift cards and aligned the recognition of gift card breakage to the updated estimated redemption pattern. As a result, the Company recognized $5.9 million of additional gift card breakage in Franchise and other revenues, partially offset by $0.6 million of associated commissions costs recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses, in the first quarter of 2022.

As of April 29, 2022 and January 28, 2022, the Company had $5.5 million of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards for state tax returns that are not included with those of other Dell entities. These net operating loss carryforwards began expiring in the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these net operating loss carryforwards, the Company has provided valuation allowances for the full amount as of April 29, 2022 and January 28, 2022. Because the Company is included in the tax filings of other Dell entities, management has determined that it will be able to realize the remainder of its deferred tax assets.

Farms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $13.2 million (66.4%) and $3.6 million (18.0%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2022.  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster (such as an earthquake, wildfire, or flood) occur or climate change impact the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  None of our farms in California or Florida have been materially impacted by the recent wildfires or hurricanes that occurred in those respective regions.  In addition, with respect to the ongoing drought taking place in the western U.S., all of our farms in the region have independent (and, in most cases, multiple) sources of water, in addition to rainfall, and have not been materially impacted by the current drought conditions.  No other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of our total lease revenue recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2022.

Products and services provided under long-term contracts represent a significant portion of sales in the Albany Engineered Composites segment and we account for these contracts using the percentage of completion (actual cost to estimated cost) method. That method requires significant judgment and estimation, which could be considerably different if the underlying circumstances were to change. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the period the change occurs. Changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts could be caused by increases or decreases in the contract value, revisions to customer delivery requirements, updated labor or overhead rates, factors affecting the supply chain, changes in the evaluation of contract risks and opportunities, or other factors. Changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts decreased operating income by $0.7 million during the first three months of 2022, compared to an insignificant effect in the same period last year.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $5 on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $32,696. The income tax benefit differs from the expected statutory amount primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance, partially offset by the permanent impact of percentage depletion deductions and the impact of state income taxes, net of federal tax impact.

We issued Convertible Senior Notes ("Convertible Notes") due March 2049 on March 18, 2019. Our Convertible Notes currently have a settlement feature requiring us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of the debt and any conversion value in excess of the principal value ("conversion premium"), for cash or shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our option. We have stated our intent to settle any conversion of these notes by paying cash for the principal value and issuing common stock for any conversion premium; however, after adopting ASU 2020-06, 2.8 million incremental shares assumed for conversion of convertible notes shall be included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation, if dilutive, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the assumed conversion resulted in an anti-dilutive impact, therefore our Convertible Notes were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share. The dilutive effect increases the more the market price exceeds the conversion price of $188.73 per share. See Note 9, Debt Obligations, to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the Convertible Notes.

During the first quarter of 2022, primarily based on data published by the Türkiye Statistical Institute that indicated that Türkiye's three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, we concluded that Türkiye became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of April 1, 2022, we expect to apply highly inflationary accounting for our subsidiaries operating in Türkiye and change their functional currency from the Turkish lira to the U.S. dollar. Our operations in Türkiye contributed $43 million, or 0.6% of our condensed consolidated net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Based on a review of our Turkish lira-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, our operations in Türkiye had an immaterial net monetary liability position as of March 31, 2022.

The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $35 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $176 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of $85 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $317 million. The decrease in income tax provision relative to the prior-year period was largely the result of the discrete tax expense the Company incurred on the gain on the sale of its Blow-Fill-Seal Business recognized in the prior-period and a shift in non-domestic pretax income to tax jurisdictions with favorable tax rates. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of the Company's pretax income resulting from the Company's business mix, changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, special items, certain equity related compensation, and other discrete tax items that may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

---

The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 of $63 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $394 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 of $91 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $494 million. The decrease in the provision relative to the prior-year period was largely the result of the discrete tax expense the Company incurred on the gain on the sale of its Blow-Fill-Seal Business recognized in the prior-period and a shift in non-domestic pretax income to tax jurisdictions with favorable tax rates, partially offset by non-U.S. tax credits claimed on an amended U.S. federal income tax filing. The provision for income taxes in each of these periods was also impacted by the relative amount and mix of permanent tax adjustments included in the income tax computation and other discrete tax items recognized in the periods.

Certain items are maintained at Corporate and are not allocated to a segment. They primarily include corporate headquarters costs, certain R&D costs, certain product category support costs, stock compensation expense, certain employee benefit plan costs, and certain gains, losses, and other charges (such as business optimization, acquisition and integration costs, intangible asset amortization and asset impairments).

In connection with our ongoing integration activities, beginning in the first quarter 2022, we have updated the measure of profitability for our Hillrom segment by excluding such unallocated costs, consistent with our legacy Baxter segments. Those unallocated costs related to Hillrom, which totaled $219 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, are now presented within Corporate as well.

The
Company has Federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $4,000,000 and state NOL carryforwards of approximately
$1,800,000. With the changes instituted by the CARES Act, the Federal NOLs have an indefinite life and will not expire. The Company’s
federal and state tax returns for the 2018 and 2019 tax years generally remain subject to examination by U.S. and various state authorities.
A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. After evaluation of the evidence, management determined that
a valuation allowance of approximately $1,256,059 for the year ended on October 31, 2021, and the fiscal six-month period ended April
30, 2022, is necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized pursuant to ASU 2019-12,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.

The Company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the net loss was $47.3 million, compared to net loss of $34.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $497.7 million. The future success of the Company is dependent on, among other factors, its ability to identify and develop its product candidates and ultimately upon its ability to attain profitable operations. The Company has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expense to support such research and development. Net losses and negative operating cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders' equity and working capital.

The Company’s facilities in Pottsville, PA (“PV”) and Guangzhou, China (“GZ”) have a tolling arrangement whereby certain surface protection films are manufactured in GZ for a fee with raw materials supplied from PV that are then shipped by GZ directly to customers principally in the Asian market, but paid by customers directly to PV.  Amounts associated with this intercompany tolling arrangement are reported in the table above as export sales from the U.S. to Asia, and include net sales of  $6.5 million and $6.9 million in the first three months of 2022 and 2021, respectively.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $1.0 million on pre-tax income of $6.1 million primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance, recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation, U.S. general business credits and a recovery of state taxes, all of which were partially offset by foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, non-deductible expenses and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits. The decrease in valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets is due to the estimated use of $0.7 million of U.S. general business credits and state net operating losses. As of March 31, 2022, the Company remains in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. However, it is possible that the Company could be out of its current three-year cumulative loss position within the next 12 months. The Company will maintain a valuation allowance on applicable deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of any or all of these valuation allowances. The Company continues to analyze the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, the valuation allowance could be reduced if there is sufficient evidence indicating it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved.

---

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $0.5 million on a pre-tax loss of $14.9 million primarily due to non-deductible expenses, foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, an increase in valuation allowance, U.S. taxation of foreign earnings and state taxes, all of which were partially offset by U.S. general business credits and recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.

As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had other warrants to purchase 1.6 million shares of Common Stock outstanding, which were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share because their exercise price was greater than the average stock price for the period and their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The operating results of Order2Cash have been included in the Company’s financial statements since the acquisition date. Order2Cash’s operating results and the goodwill resulting from the acquisition are reported in the Company’s Software and Payments segment. The acquisition added approximately $1.4 million of additional revenue and $1.4 million of direct expenses, including intangible amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Had the Company acquired Order2Cash in prior periods, the Company's operating results would have been materially different. As a result the following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented as if Order2Cash had been acquired by the Company on January 1, 2021 (in thousands):

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of March 31, 2022 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of therapeutic product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development, and clinical manufacturing of its and its collaborators' therapeutic product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $19,251 and, as of March 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $1,916,135. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development (which could occur through debt or equity issuances, sales or partnerships of non-core assets, corroborations or licensing of core or non-core assets, or other transactions), adequately satisfy or renegotiate long-term debt obligations, obtain regulatory approval of its therapeutic product candidates, successfully commercialize its therapeutic product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company incurred losses of $34,252
and $24,846 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of
$0, and accumulated deficit of $9,513,452. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern. Management believes that the Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success
of the Company’s efforts to complete a merger or acquisition, and the Company’s efforts to raise capital. Management also
believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for working capital purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be
available on acceptable terms in the future. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.

The accounting policies of each segment are the same as those followed by the company as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are priced as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Accordingly, the ECS segment records intersegment revenue and manufacturing profit on hardware and software shipments to customers under contracts of other segments. These segments, in turn, record customer revenue and marketing profits on such shipments of company hardware and software to customers.  In the company’s consolidated statements of income (loss), the manufacturing costs of products sourced from the ECS segment and sold to other segments’ customers are reported in cost of revenue for these other segments.  Also included in the ECS segment’s sales and gross profit are sales of hardware and software sold to other segments for internal use in their engagements. The amount of such profit included in gross profit of the ECS segment for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $0.7 million. The sales and profit on these transactions are eliminated in Corporate.

issued. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s December
31, 2021, financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial

Since inception, the Company has funded operations primarily through private and public placements of its equity, debt and warrants and through fees, cost reimbursements and payments received from its licensees. The Company commenced generating product revenues related to sales of AMZEEQ and ZILXI in January 2020 and October 2020, respectively.

The Company has incurred losses from continuing operations and experienced negative operating cash flows since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur losses until such a time when its product candidates, if approved, are commercially successful, if at all. The Company will not generate any revenue from any current or future product candidates unless and until it obtains regulatory approval and commercializes such products. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company generated net income of $4.7 million and used $10.0 million of cash in operations.

Our participating securities include share-based payment awards that contain a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends and are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders.  Participating securities excluded from weighted average common shares outstanding were 239,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022.

All prior period amounts have been restated, which impacts both segment reporting and adjusted operating income, but does not impact results reported under GAAP. The Full Service Retirement business generated a pre-tax loss of $206 million and pre-tax income of $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, respectively. These amounts exclude the impact of overhead costs, retained in the Company’s Corporate and Other operations, that will not be transferred to the buyer or eliminated with the sale.

---

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, as applicable, were based on 5.1 million and 6.0 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

the second quarter of 2022, the situation of COVID-19 in the PRC intensified, the PRC central and local government continued to maintain
restrictions, quarantines, and closures in certain affected areas. The approval process of our applications for the construction permits
of smart kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies and the construction project of smart kiosks was also postponed. The Company

Income
taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply when the
asset is realized or the liability settled. The effect on future tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that enactment occurs. To the extent that the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a future tax
asset will be recovered, it provides a valuation allowance against the excess. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax
benefits, if any, are classified as additional income taxes in the statement of operations. The current period net income will be offset
against the prior periods net operating losses which were approximately $32 million as of January 31, 2022 resulting in no current period
income tax expense or benefit.  The Company continues to record a valuation allowance to fully offset the deferred tax asset.

In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has included 271,933 and 320,588 common equivalent shares in the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, relating to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.

---

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at March 31, 2022 and 2021, is considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements, for the six months ended April 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $41,679 and a net cash
used in operations of $124,814, and at April 30, 2022, had a stockholders’ deficit of $132,923. These factors, among others, raise

are issued. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s October
31, 2021, financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial

The Company adopted an accounting policy to combine lease and nonlease components. Rent escalators based on indices and reimbursements of operating expenses that are not included in the lease rate are considered variable lease payments. Variable payments are recognized in the period earned. Lease income for the Company's operating leases recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $138.5 million.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, as applicable, were based on 4.9 million and 5.9 million of such awards, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, as applicable, were based on 5.0 million and 5.9 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

We generally lease our office properties to lessees in exchange for fixed monthly payments that cover rent, property taxes, insurance and certain cost recoveries, primarily common area maintenance. Office properties owned by us that are under lease are primarily located in Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond and Tampa and are leased to a wide variety of lessees across many industries. Our leases are operating leases and mostly range from three to 10 years. We recognized rental and other revenues related to operating lease payments of $200.7 million and $182.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $404.3 million and $362.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in these amounts are variable lease payments of $17.7 million and $14.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $35.0 million and $29.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

---

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $0.8 million on pre-tax income of $3.9 million primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance, U.S. general business credits and recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation, all of which were partially offset by non-deductible expenses, foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and state taxes.

---

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $1.8 million on pre-tax income of $10.0 million primarily due to a decrease in valuation allowance, recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation, U.S. general business credits and a recovery of state taxes, all of which were partially offset by foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, non-deductible expenses and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits. The decrease in valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets is due to the estimated use of $1.1 million of U.S. general business credits and state net operating losses. As of June 30, 2022, the Company remains in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. However, it is possible that the Company could be out of its current three-year cumulative loss position within the next 12 months. The Company will maintain a valuation allowance on applicable deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of any or all of these valuation allowances. The Company continues to analyze the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, the valuation allowance could be reduced if there is sufficient evidence indicating it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved.

For the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $0.6 million on a pre-tax loss of $11.7 million primarily due to non-deductible expenses, foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, state taxes, and an increase in valuation allowance, all of which were partially offset by U.S. general business credits and recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.

---

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $0.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $26.6 million primarily due to non-deductible expenses, foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, an increase in valuation allowance and state taxes, all of which were partially offset by U.S. general business credits and recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.

The accounting policies of each segment are the same as those followed by the company as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are priced as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Accordingly, the ECS segment records intersegment revenue and manufacturing profit on hardware and software shipments to customers under contracts of other segments. These segments, in turn, record customer revenue and marketing profits on such shipments of company hardware and software to customers.  In the company’s consolidated statements of income (loss), the manufacturing costs of products sourced from the ECS segment and sold to other segments’ customers are reported in cost of revenue for these other segments.  Also included in the ECS segment’s sales and gross profit are sales of hardware and software sold to other segments for internal use in their engagements. The amount of such profit included in gross profit of the ECS segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The sales and profit on these transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Since inception, the Company has incurred recurring losses including net losses of $90.0 million and $300.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.

The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations.

The Company prepared its consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. While the Company reported net income of approximately $0.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 as a result of the one-time payment due upon the effectiveness of the license agreement entered into with Organon to commercialize XACIATO, it has a history of losses from operations, expects negative cash flows from its operations to continue for the foreseeable future, and expects that its net losses will continue for at least the next several years as it develops and seeks to bring to market its existing product candidates and to potentially acquire, license and develop additional product candidates. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Commencing
January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with an IR/PR Company whereby compensation will be $1,500 per month

The Bridger Order allows Idaho Power to earn a return on and recover through 2030 the net book value of coal-related assets at the Jim Bridger plant as of December 31, 2020, as well as forecasted coal-related investments, which resulted in Idaho Power's deferral of certain depreciation expense during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022. The deferral and impacts of the Bridger Order resulted in an increase in net income for the first half of 2022 of approximately $9 million, all of which was recorded during the second quarter of 2022.

As
of June 30, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $842,576 and a stockholders’ liabilities of $16,056, and for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 had a net loss of $15,919. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and
implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern. Management is taking various steps to provide the Company with the opportunity to continue as a going
concern.

absorb losses that are potentially significant and the Company controls the majority of the activities that impact the Georgia JV’s
economic performance, specifically control of the INVOcell and lab services quality management. As a result, the Company consolidated
the Georgia JV’s results with its own. As of June 30, 2022, the Company invested $0.8 million in the Georgia JV in the form of

applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has a cumulative net loss from inception to June 30, 2022 of approximately $23 million. The accompanying financial statements

These
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the unaudited
consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses from continuing operations and net cash used by continuing operations of
$1,906,043 and
$1,092,235
for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and a loss of $190,280
and cash provided by continuing operations $66,355
for the six months ended June 30, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date that these unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued. Management cannot provide
assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations, become cash flow positive or raise additional capital. The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. They do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability and/or classification of the recorded asset amounts and/or the classification of the liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

income tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company has
a $485,102 net income during the six months ended June 30, 2022 but it was mainly from the gain of change in fair value in derivative
of $3,150,739 and it is a non-taxable event so would have a taxable loss, and continue to record a valuation allowance.

The
performance grants vest as follows: 1,083,332 restricted common shares upon Agora deploying a 20 MW power contract in Texas; and 1,083,332
restricted common shares upon the Company deploying a 40 MW power contract in Texas. As of March 31, 2022, none of the performance criteria
are probable as no contracts have been signed as the proper funding has not been secured, therefore no compensation expense is recognized
in accordance with ASC 718-10-25-20 related to the performance grants. On April 12, 2022, Agora upon board of director approval accelerated
the vesting of 250,000 restricted shares for deploying a 20 MW power contract in Texas; and 250,000 restricted shares for deploying a
40 MW power contract in Texas with Agora’s former Chief Financial Officer. All remaining performance grants remain unvested.

For the three months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded income tax benefit of $2.9 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $5.7 million, which differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $1.1 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $6.7 million, which differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act carryback benefit previously recognized, partially offset by excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation.

As
of June 30, 2022, the Company’s estimate of the amount for which it is reasonably assured of meeting the underlying terms and
conditions was based on, among other things, the various notices issued by HHS in September 19, 2020, October 22, 2020, and January
15, 2021 and the Company’s results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022. The Company believes that it was appropriate to recognize $12.4
million of the HHS Provider Relief Funds as income in various periods, including the three and six months ended Jun 30, 2021, as
discussed in the paragraph above. Accordingly, the $12.4 million is not recognized as a liability at June 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021. Additional guidance or new and amended interpretations of existing guidance on the terms and conditions of such payments may
result in changes in the Company’s estimate of amounts for which the terms and conditions are reasonably assured of being met,
and any such changes may be material. Additionally, any such changes may result in derecognition of amounts of income previously
recognized, which may be material. If we are unable to attest to or comply with current or future terms and conditions, and there is
no assurance we will be able to do so, our ability to retain some or all of the funds received may be impacted.

Since acquisition, Mio-Guard has generated $1,371,197 of revenue and has generated net earnings before tax of $96,629. These amounts are included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, Mio-Guard's revenue would have been $1,436,750 and profit before tax would have been $69,624. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, consolidated revenues would have been $10,114,100 and consolidated losses before tax would have been ($3,255,653). The pro forma unaudited results include estimates and assumptions which management believes are reasonable. These assumptions include an adjustment to operating income for one-time transactional costs that would not have occurred without the acquisition of Simbex. Additionally, the pro forma results do not include any cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of these entities and may not be fully indicative of the results that would have occurred if the business combination had been in effect on the dates indicated.

We calculate basic and diluted earnings per share using the two-class method.  Earnings per share under the two-class method is calculated using net income attributable to common stockholders, which is net income reduced by the earnings allocated to participating securities.  Our participating securities include share-based payment awards that contain a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends and are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders.  Participating securities excluded from weighted average common shares outstanding were 218 thousand in the second quarter of 2022 and 229 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

---

Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We recorded changes to project cost estimates that unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $30 and $26 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.

---

The Company had a net loss for the three
months ended June 30, 2022 of $4,225 that raises substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

---

---

During the six month period ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of $15 million which reflects income tax expense in countries where the Company is profitable, accrued withholding taxes, and the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and/or recognize expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions, including the United States ("U.S."), due to valuation allowances. Pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $13 million and $34 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate.

We enter into operating leases for the use of our owned production facilities and office buildings. Lease payments received under these agreements consist of fixed payments for the rental of space and certain building operating costs, as well as variable payments based on usage of production facilities and services, and escalating costs of building operations. We recorded total lease income, including both fixed and variable amounts, of $19 million and  $34 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $35 million and $71 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The lower lease income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared with the same periods in 2021 is the result of the sales of a production facility and an office building during the fourth quarter of 2021.

The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years.

---

Also in March 2021, the Company earned a $13.0 million milestone from AstraZeneca related to the initiation of the phase 2a study for PRS-060/AZD1402. The Company assessed the milestone payment under ASC 606 and determined that there no longer existed a constraint on the milestone as the performance obligation related to the phase 2a study was fully satisfied. Therefore, the Company realized the full $13.0 million as milestone revenue during the quarter ended March 31, 2021.

---

Hedging gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were $0.1 million, net of provision for income taxes of less than $0.1 million. We did not have any open derivative positions for the three and  six months ended June 30, 2021.

Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were $2.009 billion and $1.184 billion, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were $4.447 billion and $2.969 billion, respectively.

---

The three and six months ended June 30, 2021 include $14.7 million and $26.7 million of sales attributable to noncontrolling interests in Timber Funds.

---

The three and six months ended June 30, 2021 include $1.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of operating income attributable to noncontrolling interests in Timber Funds.

---

For the 13-weeks ended July 30, 2022, we also excluded 94,962 and 55,084 unvested stock awards granted to certain employees from the computations of diluted weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding because they are subject to certain performance-based annual vesting conditions which had not been achieved by July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively. Assuming the performance-criteria had been achieved as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, the incremental impact would have been 5,003 shares and 17,216 shares, respectively.

As part of its annual assessment of gift card breakage and during the twenty-eight weeks ended July 10, 2022, the Company re-evaluated the estimated redemption pattern related to gift cards and aligned the recognition of gift card breakage to the updated estimated redemption pattern. As a result, the Company recognized $5.9 million of additional gift card breakage in Franchise and other revenues, partially offset by $0.6 million of associated commissions costs recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses, in the first quarter of 2022. This change in accounting estimate decreased net loss by $5.2 million, or $0.33 per basic and diluted share for the twenty-eight weeks ended July 10, 2022. The Company does not expect the impact of this change in estimate to be material to its future financial statements.

---

During 2020, 2021, and 2022, performance share awards were granted to certain executive officers and key employees of the Company that will result in the issuance of common stock if the predefined performance criteria are met.  The awards provide for an aggregate target of  279,374 shares, of which none have been included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the three or six months ended June 30, 2022 because the related threshold award performance levels have not been achieved as of June 30, 2022.  See Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation and Equity for more information.

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company's income tax expense was $1.8 million on a pre-tax loss of $3.4 million. Income tax expense in the second quarter of 2022 was negatively impacted by valuation allowances recorded against U.S. tax assets as well as certain non-deductible expenses. This compares to an income tax benefit of $3.2 million on a pre-tax loss of $18.5 million, which included certain non-deductible expenses, for the three months ended June 30, 2021.

---

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company's income tax expense was $5.2 million on a pre-tax loss of $9.3 million. Income tax expense in the first six months of 2022 was negatively impacted by valuation allowances recorded against U.S. tax assets as well as certain non-deductible expenses and discrete tax items. This compares to an income tax benefit of $5.5 million on a pre-tax loss of $36.6 million, which included certain non-deductible expenses and discrete tax items, for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

For the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of $1.0 million and $2.2 million on pretax loss of $39.8 million and $66.8 million, respectively. The income tax expense was primarily related to tax liability from the Company's foreign and domestic opera

---

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $43 million on loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $61 million. This compares to an income tax expense of $41 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $58 million in the three months ended June 30, 2021. Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to pre-tax income that is taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate and a disproportionate share of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances for which no tax benefit is recognized.

The details of the change in gross written premiums and policy acquisitions costs are described below.

---

Pretax earnings attributable to our personal lines operating segment for the six months ended June 30, 2022 decreased $36,579,000, or 54.7%, to a pre-tax loss of $103,481,000 from a pre-tax loss of $66,902,000 for the same period in 2021.

The
Company recorded income tax expense during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 of $63,683 and $43,649, respectively with income
before income taxes of $157,012 and a loss before income taxes of $1,124,924, respectively. The reason that the Company has income tax
expense greater than income before income taxes is due to the Company having taxable income in a foreign tax jurisdiction. In the U.S.
the Company is not subject to U.S. taxes due to having a taxable loss.

---

Additionally, the Company uses the if-converted method to calculate the impact of the Convertible Notes on diluted earnings (loss) per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, all such if-converted securities were excluded from potentially dilutive securities because of their anti-dilutive effect on loss per share. Such securities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were approximately 33.4 million, and such securities for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were approximately 33.3 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, such potentially dilutive securities included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share were 33.3 million. See Notes 1 and 6 for further discussion of the Convertible Notes.

The
Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. For the six months ended June 30,
2022, the Company reported a net loss of $5.6 million and an accumulated deficit of $26.9 million and does not expect to generate positive
cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to incur significant and increasing losses until regulatory
approval is granted for its first product candidate, RenovoGem™. Regulatory approval is not guaranteed and may never be obtained.
The Company may seek to raise additional capital through debt financings, private or public equity financings, license agreements, collaborative
agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources of financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will
be available or will be at terms acceptable to the Company. The inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact
on the Company’s financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company will need to generate significant
revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so.

and used cash of $1,124,630 in operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern. We have evaluated the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability as a going
concern within one year of issuance of the financial statements.

The Company evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution, as presented in the tables below, is defined as operating income or loss excluding certain Cost of services and product development expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Depreciation, Amortization of intangibles, and Acquisition and integration charges. Certain bonus and fringe benefit costs included in consolidated Cost of services and product development are not allocated to segment expense. The accounting policies used by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the Company. There are no intersegment revenues. The Company does not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by reportable segment. Accordingly, assets are not reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of segment performance or in making decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and
discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we
incurred a net loss of $1,849,495, had a working capital deficit of $6,876,837 and had an accumulated deficit of $18,675,659 at June
30, 2022. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or
obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations as they come
due. There is no assurance that these events will be satisfactorily completed. As a result, there is doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern for one year from the issuance date of these financial statements

The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for illustrative purposes only, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 as if CIT had been acquired on January 1, 2021. The unaudited estimated pro forma information combines the historical results of CIT with the BancShares’ consolidated historical results and includes certain adjustments for the respective periods. The following key adjustments were made to reflect the pro forma results as if the CIT Merger was completed on January 1, 2021: (i) provision for credit losses of $513 million related to the Non-PCD loans and leases and unfunded commitments; (ii) merger and integration costs of $34 million and $169 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively; (iii) estimated purchase accounting adjustment (“PAA”) accretion and amortization related to fair value adjustments and intangibles associated with the CIT Merger; and (iv) $431 million preliminary gain on acquisition. BancShares expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies as a result of the acquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts that follow. The pro forma information should not be relied upon as being indicative of the historical results of operations that would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on January 1, 2021. Actual results may differ from the unaudited pro forma information presented below and the differences could be significant.

The new MFS segment will include the Company’s fluid management solutions for medical, high-tech industrial and other diverse end markets. Related plastic tubing, balloons, catheters, syringes, cartridges, tips, and fluid connection components are used to dispense or control fluids within customers’ medical devices or products, as well as production processes. This remains one of the Company’s growth engines both organically and acquisitively. In fiscal 2021, this segment had revenues of approximately $0.6 billion.

---

The ATS segment now will focus on products serving electronics end markets. ATS products integrate our proprietary technologies found in progressive stages of an electronics customer’s production processes, such as surface treatment, precisely controlled dispensing of material and test and inspection to ensure quality and reliability. Applications include, but are not limited to, semiconductors, printed circuit boards, electronic components, and automotive electronics. In fiscal 2021, this segment had revenues of approximately $0.5 billion.

---

There is no change to the IPS segment, which is focused on delivering proprietary dispensing and processing technology, both standard and highly customized equipment, to diverse end markets. Product lines for IPS commonly reduce material consumption, increase line efficiency through precision dispense and measurement and control, and enhance product brand and appearance.

Our second quarter 2022 EBT was $903 million, $720 million lower than a year ago, primarily reflecting lower lease residual gains driven by lower lease return volume, unfavorable changes in net financing margin, lower volume due to supply constraints on new vehicle production, and lower credit loss reserve releases, partially offset by positive market valuation adjustments to derivatives (which is included in Other).  ROE was 26.4%, 20.5 percentage points lower than a year ago driven by lower net income.  Total net receivables were $2.1 billion lower than a year ago, a 2% decline, primarily reflecting lower volume due to supply constraints and lower Ford Credit share, and exchange, partially offset by an increase in wholesale receivables.  The LTR ratio remained at a low level in the second quarter of 2022, at five basis points, 12 basis points higher than a year ago.  Second quarter 2022 auction values were 8% higher than a year ago.  Our balance sheet is strong and inherently liquid, reflecting cumulative debt maturities having a longer tenor than asset maturities.  This means that we generate liquidity as our balance sheet size declines because of lower Ford volume.  At the end of the second quarter, we had $25.0 billion in net liquidity.

Historically,
we have relied upon cash from financing activities to fund substantially all of the cash requirements of our activities and have incurred
significant losses and experienced negative cash flow. The Company had net losses from continuing operations of $5,123,407, and $4,730,612,
for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We cannot predict if we will be profitable. We may continue to incur losses
for an indeterminate period of time and may be unable to achieve profitability. An extended period of losses and negative cash flow may
prevent us from successfully operating and expanding our business. We may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly
or annual basis. On June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $816,146 and a working capital deficit of approximately $2.5 million.

These
financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon
the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to support operations,
and the attainment of profitable operations.  During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company had service revenues of CreateApp
in the amount of $4,942,392 and had negative cash flows from operating activities.  As of June 30, 2022, the Company had an
accumulated deficit of $(2,102,989). These factors raise substantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
These financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Additionally, unvested stock-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (participating securities) have been included in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the portion of the periods that the awards were outstanding. Weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock included 0.1 million and 0.6 million weighted average participating securities for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and 0.2 million and 0.8 million weighted average participating securities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

---

For the three months ended June 30, 2022, any such amounts have been excluded from the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock as we were in a net loss position and the effect of inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Assuming we had net income for the quarter, using the treasury stock method, the assumed conversion of our restricted stock would have been in the amount of 816,708 shares.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the additional dilutive effect of dilutive securities during each period. The Company’s dilutive securities are its options and RSUs. Based on the treasury stock method, the Company had 100,659 and 75,829 potentially dilutive securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively and 1,253,675 potentially dilutive securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, which were excluded due to the Company's loss position.

Our products require specialized parts which have become more difficult to source. In some cases, we have had to purchase such parts from third-party brokers at substantially higher prices. Additionally, to mitigate for component shortages, we have begun to increase inventory levels and may continue to do so for an extended period. In the event demand doesn't materialize, we may need to hold excess inventory for several quarters. Alternatively, we may be unable to source sufficient components, even from third-party brokers, to meet customer demand, resulting in high levels of unshippable backlog. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our normal lead times to secure normal and incremental future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future. The $5 million operating loss in the current quarter was mainly due to costs associated with global supply chain constraints and restructuring charges. The Company expended over $5 million during Q1FY23 which was a planned increase in inventory as part of the Company's supply chain strategy. Despite the increased spending level, the Company still maintained working capital of over $31 million as of June 30, 2022. The cash flow used in operating activities of our continuing operations was approximately $7.2 million which was primarily driven by a planned increase in inventory as part of the Company’s supply chain strategy to help assure the Company has product and raw materials to satisfy customer demand. Although the Company's tactic to mitigate the current global supply chain issues by accumulating inventory in the current period resulted in a significant usage of cash in the current period, the Company does not expect to apply the same course of action, in the same magnitude, in future periods. Still, we may remain supply-constrained beyond the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022.

In the context of this program, the Company sells product to a distributor who in turn ships product to pharmacies after receiving requests from physicians for patients in France. In November 2021, the Company began distributing and recognizing revenue from sales of Zokinvy (lonafarnib) through a reimbursed early access program in France. There was no revenue from sale of product under the ATU program for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

In the second quarter of 2021, in connection with the Company’s modifications to the SL-279252 clinical development plan and its intention to expand the dose escalation portion of its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, the estimated total costs related to the SL-279252 development program increased. The increase in expected total cost of the development program required to satisfy a specific performance obligation in the August 2017 Collaboration Agreement with Takeda (the “Collaboration Agreement”), or the denominator in the cost-based input method, resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment under ASC 250, Change in Accounting Estimates. Actual consideration received and total revenue expected to be recognized in accordance with the development of SL-279252 under the Collaboration Agreement remained unchanged. The Company recognized revenue related to the reimbursable costs as they were incurred. The effects of this change in the Company's estimates were a $4.2 million increase in 2021 net loss and a $0.10 increase in 2021 basic and diluted loss per share. The Collaboration Agreement was mutually terminated pursuant to a termination agreement dated November 8, 2021 (the “Termination Agreement”). The remaining deferred revenue was recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.

a net loss of $406,242. The Company has also incurred cumulative net losses of $36,179,403 since its inception and requires capital for
its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. These factors, among others, raises substantial doubt about the

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, during the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss
of $13,363 and used
cash in operations of $11,002.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date these financial statements were issued.

On a historical basis, without any effect of purchase accounting, KCS recorded net income attributable to controlling interests of  $248 million (U.S. $194 million) in the second quarter of 2022, a favourable change of $714 million (U.S. $573 million), or 153%, from a $466 million (U.S. $379 million) net loss. This change was primarily due to lower acquisition-related costs, including the merger termination fee paid to CP in the same period of 2021, and higher revenues of $123 million (U.S. $96 million), partially offset by higher fuel cost of $56 million (U.S. $44 million). Acquisition-related costs (net of tax) incurred by KCS in the second quarter of 2022 were $14 million (U.S. $11 million), a decrease of $686 million (U.S. $558 million), or 98%, from $700 million (U.S. $569 million) in the same period of 2021. These values have been translated at the average FX rate of $1.28 and $1.23 CAD per USD for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

On a historical basis, without any effect of purchase accounting, KCS recorded net income attributable to controlling interests of $485 million (U.S. $382 million) in the first six months of 2022, a favourable change of $768 million (U.S. $608 million), or 271%, from a $283 million (U.S. $226 million) net loss. This change was primarily due to lower acquisition-related costs, including the merger termination fee paid to CP in the same period of 2021, and higher revenues of $214 million (U.S. $168 million), partially offset by higher fuel cost of $89 million (U.S. $70 million). Acquisition-related costs (net of tax) incurred by KCS in the first six months of 2022 were $27 million (U.S. $21 million), a decrease of $710 million (U.S. $568 million), or 96%, from $737 million (U.S. $589 million) in the same period of 2021. These values have been translated at the average FX rate of $1.27 and $1.25 CAD per USD for the first six months of 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Management
does not expect existing cash as of June 30, 2022, to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months
from the issuance date of these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes
the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2022,
the Company has incurred losses totaling $1.8 million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue from operations, and will
require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to finance operating
costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital through equity offerings,
debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company has experienced net losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $174.8 million as of June 30, 2022 and net loss of $18.3 million and $32.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of June 30, 2022, as well as expected proceeds from the sale of Trans Ova (see Note 3),  will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of therapeutic product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development, and clinical manufacturing of its therapeutic product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $36,886 and, as of June 30, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $1,933,770. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development (which could occur through debt or equity issuances, sales or partnerships of non-core assets, collaborations or licensing of core or non-core assets, or other transactions), adequately satisfy or renegotiate long-term debt obligations, obtain regulatory approval of its therapeutic product candidates, successfully commercialize its therapeutic product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

Since inception, the Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of shares of common stock and debt financing. The Company incurred net losses during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 of $(94,973) thousand and $(12,580) thousand, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of $(157,579) thousand at June 30, 2022. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses and consume significant cash resources for the foreseeable future. These operating losses and accumulated deficits raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, meaning that the Company may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, complete development of new seeds and produce, and attain profitability. The Company has implemented and continues to implement plans to fund its operations and finance its future development activities and its working capital needs. However, substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern still exists.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 11,592,699 and 11,651,811 common shares held in a grantor trust as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.

We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2022 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from four to five years and for our networking equipment from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for Q2 2022, based on servers and networking equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of March 31, 2022 and those acquired during the three months ended June 30, 2022, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $928 million and a benefit to net loss of $728 million, or $0.07 per basic share and $0.07 per diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the six months ended June 30, 2022, based on servers and networking equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2021 and those acquired during the six months ended June 30, 2022, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.9 billion and a benefit to net loss of $1.5 billion, or $0.15 per basic share and $0.15 per diluted share.

MasTec operates primarily in the United States and Canada, and, to a far lesser extent, in Mexico, the Caribbean and India.  Revenue derived from U.S. operations totaled $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion for the three month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and totaled $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion for the six month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Revenue derived from foreign operations totaled $51.3 million and $33.4 million for the three month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and totaled $75.8 million and $79.9 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Revenue from foreign operations was derived primarily from the Company’s Canadian operations in its Oil and Gas segment, and, to a lesser extent, from the Company’s operations in Mexico.  Long-lived assets held in the U.S. included property and equipment, net, of $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and for the Company’s businesses in foreign countries, totaled $23.9 million and $24.5 million, respectively.  Intangible assets and goodwill, net, related to the Company’s U.S. operations totaled approximately $2.1 billion as of both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and for the Company’s businesses in foreign countries, totaled approximately $40.7 million and $43.8 million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.  Substantially all of the Company’s long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill in foreign countries relate to its Canadian operations.  As of both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, amounts due from customers from which foreign revenue was derived accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s consolidated net accounts receivable position, which represents accounts receivable, net, less deferred revenue.  Revenue from governmental entities for both the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2022 totaled approximately 7% of total revenue, and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2021, totaled approximately 6% and 5%, respectively, substantially all of which was derived from the Company’s U.S. operations.

Income tax expense for the three months ended July 31, 2022, reflects an increase in tax expense relating to stock-based compensation and final U.S. foreign tax credit regulations enacted in fiscal 2023, offset by a U.S. foreign derived intangible income benefit driven by the capitalization of research and development expenditures starting in fiscal 2023 as required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”).

Income tax expense for the six months ended July 31, 2022, reflects an increase in tax expense relating to stock-based compensation and final U.S. foreign tax credit regulations enacted in fiscal 2023, offset by a U.S. foreign derived intangible income benefit driven by the capitalization of research and development expenditures starting in fiscal 2023 as required by the Tax Act. In addition, fiscal 2022 included a non-recurring discrete tax benefit relating to the Supreme Court decision in India on the taxability of software license payments to nonresidents.

For the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, the average market price of the company's common stock exceeded the exercise price of the Convertible Notes (as defined below) resulting in 1,150,852 and 1,430,308 diluted common stock equivalents to be included in the diluted net earnings per share, respectively. There have been no material conversions to date. See Note 12, Financing Arrangements for further details on the Convertible Notes. There were no anti-dilutive restricted stock grants excluded from common stock equivalents in any period presented.

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed financial statements, for the nine month period ended June 30, 2022 the Company generated net
income of $2,268 and provided cash by operations of $3,774. At June 30, 2022, the Company has a working capital deficit of $85,228. The
foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the
issuance date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the
recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to implement its business
plan and continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is actively seeking investor funding.

Farms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $26.8 million (66.5%) and $7.2 million (17.9%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2022.  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster (such as an earthquake, wildfire, or flood) occur or climate change impact the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  None of our farms in California or Florida have been materially impacted by the recent wildfires or hurricanes that occurred in those respective regions.  In addition, with respect to the ongoing drought taking place in the western U.S., all of our farms in the region have independent (and, in most cases, multiple) sources of water, in addition to rainfall, and have not been materially impacted by the current drought conditions.  No other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of our total lease revenue recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Basic earnings per share of common stock are computed by dividing net earnings available to each class of common stockholders on an as if distributed basis by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share, by definition, reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock, that then shared in the distributed earnings of each class of common stock. U.S. GAAP requires a two-class presentation for the Company's two classes of common stock. The Company currently has no share-based compensation awards outstanding that could be redeemed for shares of common stock.

---

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $1,498,000 and $1,000, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and $2,988,000 and $1,000, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Time-based restricted stock units, nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.

Impairments and other charges recognized may not result in significant tax benefit due to our inability to forecast realization of the tax benefit of such losses.

If D-Wave is unable to obtain additional financing, operations may be scaled back or discontinued. These conditions give rise to material uncertainties that may cast substantial doubt on the ability of D-Wave to continue as a going concern.

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to Driven Brands Holdings Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Because the Company reported a net loss for the three and six months ended June 25, 2022, the number of shares used to calculate diluted loss per share is the same as the number of shares used to calculate basic loss per share because the potentially dilutive shares, if any, would have been antidilutive if included.

Company has generated minimal revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating losses of $400,163 through the period ended
June 30, 2022. As a result of the management and control changes, the Stock Purchase Agreement, signed on March 10, 2021, the Company
impaired all of its existing assets. That agreement also required the repayment of all existing liabilities, some of which activity is
yet to be verified. These activities raise additional doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations
and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized income tax expense of $2.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, on a pre-tax loss of $13.0 million and $29.4 million, respectively. The Company calculated the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, using the discrete effective tax rate method as the annual effective tax rate method would not provide a reliable estimate. Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to the change from the annual effective tax rate method used in the first quarter of 2022 to the discrete effective tax rate method, and state and foreign income tax expense as a result of current taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to state and foreign income tax expense as a result of current taxable income in certain jurisdictions.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized income tax expense of $0.1 million on a pre-tax income of $4.1 million, and an income tax benefit of $0.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $1.1 million respectively. The Company calculated the provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to ordinary income (loss) adjusted by the tax impact of discrete items. The income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to the pre-tax loss position, partially offset by state and foreign income tax expense as a result of current taxable income in certain jurisdictions.

For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s income tax provision of $15.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively, on a net income before income taxes of $92.2 million and $46.3 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company’s income tax provision of $20.8 million on a net income before income taxes of $149.6 million was calculated using the annualized effective tax rate method and was primarily due to projected tax expense in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that are profitable, partially offset by tax deduction from employee stock compensation reported as a discrete event. 

---

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s income tax benefit of $26.4 million, on a net income before income taxes of $44.7 million calculated using the annualized effective tax rate method, was primarily due to tax deduction in the first quarter of 2021 from employee stock compensation reported as a discrete event, partially offset by projected tax expense in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that are profitable.

Income
taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply when the
asset is realized or the liability settled. The effect on future tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that enactment occurs. To the extent that the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a future tax
asset will be recovered, it provides a valuation allowance against the excess. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax
benefits, if any, are classified as additional income taxes in the statement of operations. The current period net income will be offset
against the prior periods net operating losses which were approximately $32 million as of January 31, 2022, resulting in no current period
income tax expense or benefit. The Company continues to record a valuation allowance to fully offset the deferred tax asset.

The
Company has incurred net losses of $7.0 million and $13.4 million for the six month period ended June 25, 2022 and for the fiscal year
ended December 25, 2021, respectively, and net cash outflows from operations of $11.4 million and $10.7 million for the six month period
ended June 25, 2022 and for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, respectively. The Company’s net cash outflows from operations
were partially a result of funding its ongoing investments in research and development which management believes will continue. The Company
has in the past sold equity securities through an At The Money program and in the traditional fashion of significant equity offerings.
Management estimates the Company will have sufficient liquidity to fund operations at least through Q3 2023. Nonetheless, management
monitors the capital markets on an ongoing basis and may consider raising capital if favorable market conditions develop. If the Company’s
actual results are less than projected or the Company needs to raise capital for additional liquidity, the Company may be required to
do additional equity financings, reduce expenses or enter into a strategic transaction. However, management can make no assurance that
the Company will be able to raise additional capital, reduce expenses sufficiently, or enter into a strategic transaction on terms acceptable
to the Company, or at all.

---

The Company recognized a net loss attributable to stockholders of $44.4 million in the first six months of 2022 compared with net income attributable to stockholders of $7.5 million in the first six months of 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of the factors affecting operating profit, the absence of a $4.6 million gain related to the sale of the Company's preferred shares of OneH2, Inc. in the first six months of 2021, higher interest expense, lower pension expense and unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on an equity investment in a third party.

The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of June 30, 2022 provides sufficient capital resources to continue its operations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The
Company’s consolidated statements of operations includes a presentation of income (loss) per share for common stock subject to
redemption in a manner similar to the two-class method of income per share. Net income (loss) per share for the three

respectively, by the weighted average number of Public Shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding Public Shares were redeemed.
The Founder and Private Placement shares are calculated separately from the Public Shares as these shares do not have any redemption
features and do not participate in the income earned on the Trust Account.

In April 2017, the FCA announced an investigation relating to suspected competition law breaches in the aviation and aerospace broking industry, which, for Aon in 2016, represented less than $100 million in global revenue. The European Commission assumed jurisdiction over the investigation in place of the FCA, and the European Commission has now closed its investigation. Other antitrust agencies outside the E.U. are conducting formal or informal investigations regarding these matters.

At this time, in light of the uncertainties and many variables involved, Aon cannot estimate the ultimate impact on our company from these investigations or any related private litigation, nor any damages, penalties, or fines related to them.

generate positive cash flow, as a lessor, the Trust leases its facilities to tenants in exchange for payments. The Trust’s leases
for its railroad, solar farms and greenhouse cultivation facilities have lease terms ranging between 5 and 99 years. Payments from the

Collectability is assessed at quarter-end for each tenant receivable using various criteria including past collection issues, the current
economic and business environment affecting the tenant and guarantees. If collectability of the contractual rent stream is not deemed
probable, revenue will only be recognized upon receipt of cash from the tenant. Total revenue from its leases recognized for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 is approximately $4,218,000 and $4,085,000, respectively.

On April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) issued a statement regarding accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by SPACs. In light of the issues raised by the SEC, the Company re-evaluated its accounting position for the warrants and concluded that certain warrants should have been classified as a liability measured at fair value for the 30-day period from September 29, 2020 to October 29, 2020. Accounting for these warrants as a liability instead of equity would have reduced non-operating expense and net loss by $1.6 million for 2020. Additionally, a corresponding $1.6 million adjustment would have been made to reduce its accumulated deficit with an offsetting adjustment to additional paid in capital in its equity accounts at December 31, 2020. The Company has concluded that the effects of accounting for the warrants as a liability instead of equity were immaterial to its previously issued financial statements and, accordingly, made an adjustment to its equity accounts for the effects of the accounting for the warrants in its consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity and balance sheet at December 31, 2021 by decreasing its accumulated deficit by $1.6 million with an offsetting decrease to its additional paid in capital.

The awards provide for an aggregate target of  279,374 shares, of which none have been included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2022 because the related threshold award performance levels have not been achieved as of September 30, 2022.  See Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation and Equity for more information.

Since acquisition, Mio-Guard has generated $3,672,264 of revenue and has generated net earnings before tax of $265,411. These amounts are included in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, Mio-Guard's revenue would have been $3,737,567 and profit before tax would have been $234,435. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, consolidated revenues would have been $20,854,025 and consolidated losses before tax would have been ($3,953,496). The pro forma unaudited results include estimates and assumptions which management believes are reasonable. These assumptions include an adjustment to operating income for one-time transactional costs that would not have occurred without the acquisition of Mio-Guard. Additionally, the pro forma results do not include any cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of these entities and may not be fully indicative of the results that would have occurred if the business combination had been in effect on the dates indicated.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the additional dilutive effect of dilutive securities during each period. The Company’s dilutive securities are its options and RSUs. Based on the treasury stock method, the Company had 96,172 and 82,685 potentially dilutive securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and 329,724 and 584,360 potentially dilutive securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, which were excluded due to the Company's loss position. Net loss applicable to common stockholders is equal to net loss less preferred dividends.

We lease Sleep and Respiratory Care medical devices to customers primarily as a means to comply with local health insurer requirements in certain foreign geographies. Device rental contracts include operating leases, and contract terms vary by customer and include options to terminate or extend the contract. When lease contracts also include the sale of masks and accessories, we allocate contract consideration to those items on a relative standalone price basis and recognize revenue when control transfers to the customer. Operating lease revenue was $23.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and $25.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021.

The Company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the net loss was $59.8 million, compared to $45.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the net loss was $159.3 million, compared to $121.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $609.8 million. The future success of the Company is dependent on, among other factors, its ability to identify and develop its product candidates and ultimately upon its ability to attain profitable operations. The Company has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expense to support such research and development. Net losses and negative operating cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders' equity and working capital.

operations, has recognized a net loss of $57,175 over the current nine-month period, has incurred significant losses since inception,
and has an accumulated deficit of $36,146,147. The Company requires additional funding from outside sources to implement its business
development strategy and has no firm commitments for such funding. The aggregation of these factors raises substantial doubt about the

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. On September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $2,440,726 and $6,067,692, respectively.
The Company’s working capital was $1,875,904 on September 30, 2022. The Company reported a net decrease in cash for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 of $3,626,966 primarily as a result of the use of cash used for the repayment
of notes payable of $809,905, cash used to purchase property and equipment of $118,617, cash used in operations of $2,839,677, and cash
used for acquisitions of $1,930,712, offset by net cash proceeds received from the sale of Series G preferred stock units of $855,000,
cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $245,714, proceeds from notes payable of $108,395, cash acquired in acquisitions of $138,336,
and net cash proceeds received from the sale of the assets of Shyp FX of $748,500. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company
issued an aggregate of 343,118 shares of its Series E preferred stock for net proceeds of $3,590,500 and issued an aggregate of 615,000
shares of its Series G preferred stock for net proceeds of $5,479,560. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company
received proceeds of $4,226,383 from the exercise of stock warrant. The proceeds were used for the acquisition of Cougar Express and
DDTI, the repayment of debt, and for working capital purposes. Historically, the Company has primarily funded its operations with proceeds
from sales of convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. Since its inception, the Company has incurred recurring losses, including
a loss from operations of $3,821,592 and $5,251,336 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Until such time
that the Company implements its growth through acquisition strategy, it expects to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable
future, mostly due to corporate overhead and costs of being a public company. The Company believes that its existing working capital
and its future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable the Company to meet its operating needs and
debt requirements for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this report.

The Company’s product revenue consists of sales of Zokinvy, which received FDA approval in November 2020 and was launched commercially in the United States in January 2021. Prior to 2021, the Company had no product revenue. In the United States, the Company sells Zokinvy to a single specialty pharmacy provider that subsequently dispenses the product directly to patients. The Company discloses revenue on a total basis without further disaggregation. Additionally, the Company does not have any contract assets or liabilities, other than accounts receivable, related to its product revenue.

In June 2021, the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) granted Zokinvy (lonafarnib) a Temporary Authorizations for Use (Autorisation Temporaire d'Utilisation or ATU) for an early access program for a term of one year. The Company has received an extension of the ATU program and expects the program to continue until commercial reimbursement of Zokinvy is approved in France. In the context of this program, the Company sells product to a distributor who in turn ships product to pharmacies after receiving requests from physicians for patients in France. In November 2021, the Company began distributing and recognizing revenue from sales of Zokinvy (lonafarnib) through a reimbursed early access program in France. There was no revenue from sale of product under the ATU program for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

We enter into operating leases for the use of our owned production facilities and office buildings. Lease payments received under these agreements consist of fixed payments for the rental of space and certain building operating costs, as well as variable payments based on usage of production facilities and services, and escalating costs of building operations. We recorded total lease income, including both fixed and variable amounts, of $16 million and  $50 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $42 million and $113 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The lower lease income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared with the same periods in 2021 is the result of the sales of a production facility and an office building during the fourth quarter of 2021.

In
connection with the preparation of our consolidated interim financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we
completed an analysis of one of our customer contracts under ASC 606 and, as a result, we determined that the performance obligations
are satisfied over time. See “Note 3 – Revenues in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Part I of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As a result of the analysis, we identified additional revenues to be recognized of $326 and
$574 related to the three months ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, along with the additional related cost
of revenues of $278 and $592, respectively.

There was $0.5 million recognized at a point in time for NRE services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Revenue recognized at a point in time for NRE services amounted to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For services performed on a customer’s owned asset, since the customer controls the asset being enhanced, revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered. There was $0.5 million recognized over time for NRE services using a cost-based input method for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Revenue recognized over time for NRE services using a cost-based input method amounted to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, and $1.7 million and $7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company is allowed to bill for services performed under the contract in the event the contract is terminated.

As
of September 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $9,597,901, stockholders’ deficit of $866,236,  net loss of $151,162 and net cash used in operations
of $0 for the period ended September 30, 2022. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for
professional fees and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern through December 31, 2022 is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders or external financing. Management
believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet with the Company’s obligations as they become due.
However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.

---

Contract
liabilities consist of amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized. The increase in contract liabilities is primarily
due to payments received for the following: $1.0 million related to future grant revenue and $0.4 million for future sales revenue during
the six months ended October 31, 2022 for which we have not recognized revenue.

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of obligations in the normal course of business. We incurred losses from continuing operations, net of income taxes, of approximately $1.9 million and $7.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $2.1 million and $4.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $135.1 million and $128.0 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents increased to $8.5 million from $4.5 million as of December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of an underwritten public offering (the “2022 Public Offering”) which closed on January 24, 2022. Refer to Note 14.

Total revenue in the United States was $19.0 million,  $23.9 million, $60.9 million and $65.0 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s assets are primarily located in the United States and therefore are not allocated to any specific geographic region.

These
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the unaudited
consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses from continuing operations and net cash used by continuing operations of
$2,448,637
and $1,488,818 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and a loss from continuing operations of $993,452
and cash used by continuing operations of $520,310 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern within one year after the date that these unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued. Management cannot
provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations, become cash flow positive or raise additional
capital. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. They do not include any
adjustments related to the recoverability and/or classification of the recorded asset amounts and/or the classification of the
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Since November 2013, the allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff has been subject to customer complaint cases and has been changed by various FERC orders. In May 2020, the FERC issued an order, which set the allowed base ROE to 10.02%, and required refunds, with interest, for the periods November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. Ameren and Ameren Illinois paid these refunds, including interest, by March 31, 2022. In June and July 2020, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, as well as various customers, petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the May 2020 order, challenging certain aspects of the new ROE methodology established. The petition filed by Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI challenged the refunds required for the period from September 2016 to May 2020. In August 2022, the court issued a ruling that granted the customers’ petition for review, vacated the FERC’s previous MISO ROE-determining orders, and remanded the proceedings to the FERC. The currently allowed base ROE of 10.02% will remain effective for customer billings, but subject to refund if the base ROE is changed by the FERC in a future order. The FERC is under no deadline to issue an order related to these proceedings. A 50 basis point change in the FERC-allowed ROE would affect Ameren’s and Ameren Illinois’ annual revenue by an estimated $17 million and $11 million, respectively, based on each company’s 2022 projected rate base.

We calculate basic and diluted earnings per share using the two-class method.  Earnings per share under the two-class method is calculated using net income attributable to common stockholders, which is net income reduced by the earnings allocated to participating securities.  Our participating securities include share-based payment awards that contain a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends and are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders.  Participating securities excluded from weighted average common shares outstanding were 213 thousand in the third quarter of 2022 and 223 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Income
taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply when the
asset is realized or the liability settled. The effect on future tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that enactment occurs. To the extent that the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a future tax
asset will be recovered, it provides a valuation allowance against the excess. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax
benefits, if any, are classified as additional income taxes in the statement of operations. The current period net income will be offset
against the prior periods net operating losses which were approximately $32 million as of January 31, 2022, resulting in no current period
income tax expense or benefit. The Company continues to record a valuation allowance to fully offset the deferred tax asset.

On a historical basis, without any effect of purchase accounting, KCS recorded net income attributable to controlling interests of  $263 million (U.S. $201 million) in the third quarter of 2022, a favourable change of $66 million (U.S. $45 million), or 34%, from a $197 million (U.S. $156 million) net Income. This change was primarily due to higher revenues of $180 million (U.S. $138 million) and lower acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher fuel cost of $56 million (U.S. $43 million). Acquisition-related costs (net of tax) incurred by KCS in the third quarter of 2022 were $12 million (U.S. $10 million), a decrease of $23 million (U.S. $18 million), or 66%, from $35 million (U.S. $28 million) in the same period of 2021. These values have been translated at the average FX rate of $1.31 and $1.26 CAD per USD for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

On a historical basis, without any effect of purchase accounting, KCS recorded net income attributable to controlling interests of $748 million (U.S. $583 million) in the first nine months of 2022, a favourable change of $835 million (U.S. $653 million), or 961%, from a $87 million (U.S. $70 million) net loss. This change was primarily due to lower acquisition-related costs, including the merger termination fee paid to CP in the same period of 2021, and higher revenues of $393 million (U.S. $306 million), partially offset by higher fuel cost of $145 million (U.S. $113 million). Acquisition-related costs (net of tax) incurred by KCS in the first nine months of 2022 were $39 million (U.S. $30 million), a decrease of $727 million (U.S. $583 million), or 95%, from $766 million (U.S. $613 million) in the same period of 2021. These values have been translated at the average FX rate of $1.28 and $1.25 CAD per USD for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Due
to the nature of the agreement, the Company’s management deemed that there was an embedded lease feature in the agreement in accordance
with ASC 842. As a result, the initial payment of $63,000 was classified as a deposit. Upon an event of default, the payment is non-refundable,
and the Company no longer has any obligation to provide access to the land. The interest payments will be recognized monthly as lease
income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized $0 and $25,900 in lease income, respectively.

In determining the most appropriate reportable segments, we consider operating segments’ economic and other characteristics, including home floor plans, average selling prices, gross margin percentage, geographical proximity, production construction processes, suppliers, subcontractors, regulatory environments, customer type and underlying demand and supply. Each operating segment follows the same accounting policies and is managed by our management team. We have no inter-segment sales, as all sales are to external customers. Operating results for each segment may not be indicative of the results for such segment had it been an independent, stand-alone entity for the periods presented.

In 2022, we elected to change our method of accounting for the United States GILTI tax from recording the tax impact in the period it is incurred to recognizing deferred taxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years. The change is considered preferable based on our facts and circumstances as it provides better and more timely information of expected future income tax liabilities arising from temporary tax differences primarily associated with the Xilinx acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $27.3 billion of identified intangible assets (refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreign operations which will be amortized to income from operations over the assets’ estimated useful lives, but for which we will not receive a tax deduction under GILTI. Recognition of deferred taxes for the future GILTI impact of this amount is considered preferable as it provides better information about our potential future tax liabilities based on current transactions. This accounting policy change resulted in the recording of $863 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed in Note 12 - Income Taxes. In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net income of $209 million and $346 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.13 and $0.23 respectively, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy. This accounting policy change had no material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Since inception, the Company has incurred recurring losses including net losses of $133.0 million and $300.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $371.6 million as of September 30, 2022 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations.

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We sustained a net loss of $3,162,632 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, and have an accumulated deficit of approximately $50,720,940 at September 30, 2022. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.1 million and $2.5 million on pretax losses of $49.6 million and $134.3 million, respectively. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 was primarily due to the Company's foreign and domestic operations and the establishment of a deferred tax liability relating to the deconsolidation of a majority-owned entity, Meltano, and simultaneous establishment of the Company's equity method investment.

---

For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $0.9 million and income tax expense of $1.4 million on pretax losses of $42.6 million and $109.4 million, respectively. The income tax benefit for the three months ended October 31, 2021 was primarily related to an increase in domestic losses from operations. The income tax expense for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 was primarily related to tax liability from the Company's foreign and domestic operations.

---

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, there were 1.90 million and 2.01 million weighted-average common shares outstanding used for the basic EPS calculation, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, approximately 0.13 million and 0.09 million shares subject to options were included in the calculation resulting in

Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,169,000 and 1,525,000 shares for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Our EPS calculations exclude 383,000 and 239,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the performance conditions have not yet been satisfied. However, the numerator for EPS calculations for each respective period is reduced by the compensation expense related to these awards.

The Company prepared its consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. Although the Company reported net income of approximately $0.4 million for its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022 as a result of the upfront one-time payment due under its license agreement with Organon to commercialize XACIATO, the Company has a history of losses from operations, expects negative cash flows from its operations to continue for the foreseeable future, and expects that its net losses will continue for at least the next several years as it develops and seeks to bring to market its existing product candidates and to potentially acquire, license and develop additional product candidates. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company formed a taxable REIT subsidiary which may generate future taxable income which may offset by the net loss carry forward. The Company considers that any deferred tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset which may be recorded in light of the net loss carry forward would be

Since
its inception, the Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $492,900
cash on hand. The Management believes that cash on hand may not be sufficient for the Company to meet working capital and corporate development
needs as they become due in the ordinary course of business for twelve (12) months following September 30, 2022. From inception to September
30, 2022, the Company had not earned any revenues and had an operating loss of $1,465,584. The Company continues to experience negative
cash flows from operations and the ongoing requirement for substantial additional capital investment to develop its financial technologies.

Himalaya
Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2003. The Company’s
principal historical activities had been the acquisition of a mineral property in the State of New Mexico. During the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2010, the Company began to acquire working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a drilling program in crude
oil and natural gas properties in Oklahoma. Prior to July 31, 2019 the Company discontinued the exploration and drilling in Oklahoma
and New Mexico. The Company has leases on two properties that were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2021. Over the past few years, the
company generated approximately $1,500 per year of net revenue from these leases. Subsequent to October 31, 2022 the Company reached
an agreement with the Company’s prior CEO to distribute the oil leases in payment of loan from shareholder.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company reported an accumulated deficit of $8,242,819
as of October 31, 2022. The Company also had negative working capital of $1,142,328 at October 31, 2022, and had operating losses of
$81,717 and $22,021 for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. To date, these losses and deficiencies have been
financed principally through the issuance of common stock, loans from related parties and loans from third parties.

Since inception, the Company has funded operations primarily through private and public placements of its equity, debt and warrants and through fees, cost reimbursements and payments received from its licensees. The Company commenced generating product revenues related to sales of AMZEEQ and ZILXI in January 2020 and October 2020, respectively. AMZEEQ and ZILXI were sold as part of the sale of the MST Franchise on January 12, 2022 and, as such, the Company no longer generates revenue from the sale of these products. The Company has incurred losses from continuing operations and experienced negative operating cash flows since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur losses until such a time when its product candidates, if approved, are commercially successful, if at all. The Company will not generate any revenue from any current or future product candidates unless and until it obtains regulatory approval and commercializes such products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company generated a net loss of $13.3 million and used $25.3 million of cash in operations.  Net loss was the result of income from discontinued operations of $12.9 million and loss from continuing operations of $26.2 million.

During the second and third quarters of 2022, we acquired the operating assets related to two travel centers we previously leased to franchisees.  Rent revenues from these operating leases totaled zero and $595 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $1,190 and $1,763 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  See Note 3 of this Quarterly Report for more information about these acquisitions.

We reported an income tax provision of $8.0 million on pretax loss of $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to an income tax provision of $0.6 million on pretax loss of $410.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflects an increase in tax expense primarily related to overall growth in foreign jurisdictions associated with an increase in profit, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and foreign tax rates. Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to different tax rates and non-deductible stock-based compensation in foreign jurisdictions in addition to full valuation allowances in the U.S. and Australia.

As part of its annual assessment of gift card breakage and during the forty weeks ended October 2, 2022, the Company re-evaluated the estimated redemption pattern related to gift cards and aligned the recognition of gift card breakage to the updated estimated redemption pattern. As a result, the Company recognized $5.9 million of additional gift card breakage in Franchise and other revenues, partially offset by $0.6 million of associated commissions costs recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses, in the first quarter of 2022. This change in accounting estimate decreased net loss by $5.2 million, or $0.33 per basic and diluted share for the forty weeks ended October 2, 2022. The Company does not expect the impact of this change in estimate to be material to its future financial statements.

Net income of Borderfree for the third quarter of 2021 was not significant.

---

September 30, 2021, the Company recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes (after application of an increase in the Company’s valuation allowance) on pre-tax loss of $34.2 million. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, differ from the 21% federal statutory rate and applicable state statutory rates primarily due to the Company’s valuation allowance on its book losses, disallowance of executive compensation expenses not deductible for tax, and to the pre-tax portion of income and losses that are passed through to the other partners of the Operating Company and the San Francisco Venture.

The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”)
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has a cumulative net loss from inception to September 30, 2022 of approximately $24 million. The accompanying financial statements
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The
Company’s cash resources from operations may be insufficient to meet its anticipated needs during the next twelve months. If the
Company does not execute its plan, it may require additional financing to fund its future planned operations.

---

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at September 30, 2022 and 2021, is considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

The Company is in the early stages of exploration and, as is common with any exploration company, it raises financing for its acquisition activities. The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will continue operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business.

Our
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, we reported revenue of $9,870,039 and an accumulated deficit of $(3,343,838) as of September 30, 2022.

adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon

experienced management and profitable operations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in achieving these objectives.

Since inception, the Company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of shares of common stock and debt financing. The Company incurred net losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $(96,052) thousand and $(24,158) thousand, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of $(158,658) thousand at September 30, 2022. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses and consume significant cash resources for the foreseeable future. These operating losses and accumulated deficits raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, meaning that the Company may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, complete development of new seeds and produce, and attain profitability. The Company has implemented and continues to implement plans to fund its operations and finance its future development activities and its working capital needs. However, substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern still exists.

Basic earnings per share of common stock are computed by dividing net earnings available to each class of common stockholders on an as if distributed basis by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share, by definition, reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock, that then shared in the distributed earnings of each class of common stock. U.S. GAAP requires a two-class presentation for the Company's two classes of common stock. The Company currently has no share-based compensation awards outstanding that could be redeemed for shares of common stock.

We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2022 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from four to five years and for our networking equipment from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs.

As of each of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022, the Company had $5.5 million of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards for state tax returns that are not included with those of other Dell entities. These net operating loss carryforwards began expiring in the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these net operating loss carryforwards, the Company has provided valuation allowances for the full amount as of October 28, 2022 and January 28, 2022. Because the Company is included in the tax filings of other Dell entities, management has determined that it will be able to realize the remainder of its deferred tax assets. If the Company's tax provision had been prepared using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma pre-tax loss, tax benefit and net loss for the nine months ended October 28, 2022 would have been $95.8 million, $4.3 million and $91.5 million, respectively, as a result of the recognition of a valuation allowance that would have been recorded on a significant amount of deferred tax assets as well as certain attributes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that would be lost if not utilized by the Dell consolidated group.

The Company recorded net losses of $12.0 million and $42.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and expects to incur losses in subsequent periods for at least the next several years and is highly dependent on its ability to find additional sources of funding through either equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing agreements or a combination of any such transactions. Management believes that the Company’s existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2022 will be sufficient to fund its current operating plans through at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Adequate additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate research and development programs, or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that the Company might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

The accounting policies of each segment are the same as those followed by the company as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are priced as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Accordingly, the ECS segment records intersegment revenue and manufacturing profit on hardware and software shipments to customers under contracts of other segments. These segments, in turn, record customer revenue and marketing profits on such shipments of company hardware and software to customers.  In the company’s consolidated statements of income (loss), the manufacturing costs of products sourced from the ECS segment and sold to other segments’ customers are reported in cost of revenue for these other segments.  Also included in the ECS segment’s sales and gross profit are sales of hardware and software sold to other segments for internal use in their engagements. The amount of such profit included in gross profit of the ECS segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $0.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The sales and profit on these transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company's leases typically have escalators that are either based on a stated percentage or an index such as the consumer price index ("CPI"). In addition, most of the Company's leases include nonlease components, such as reimbursement of operating expenses as additional rent, or include the reimbursement of expected operating expenses as part of the lease payment. The Company adopted an accounting policy to combine lease and nonlease components. Rent escalators based on indices and reimbursements of operating expenses that are not included in the lease rate are considered variable lease payments. Variable payments are recognized in the period earned. Lease income for the Company's operating leases recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $298.9 million and $578.1 million, respectively. Lease income for the Company's operating leases recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $131.7 million and $388.6 million, respectively.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The new guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB amended the new lease standard which, among other changes, allows a company to elect to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a transition option whereby a cumulative effect adjustment is recorded to the opening balance of its retained earnings on the adoption date. The Company has elected to use this modified retrospective transition option and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.5 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2022. The Company also elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities of $13.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively. The standard did not have a significant effect on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss and Cash Flows. See Note 4 for additional lease disclosures.

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $1,497,000 and $1,000, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and $4,485,000 and $2,000, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Time-based restricted stock units, nonvested shares of our restricted common stock and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.

Management
does not expect existing cash as of September 30, 2022, to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months
from the issuance date of these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumed
the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2022,
the Company has incurred losses totaling $16.7 million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue from operations, and will
require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to finance operating
costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital through equity offerings,
debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The
Trust has elected to be treated for tax purposes as a REIT, which means that it is exempt from U.S. federal income tax if a sufficient
portion of its annual income is distributed to its shareholders, and if certain other requirements are met. In order for the Trust to
maintain its REIT qualification, at least 90% of its ordinary taxable annual income must be distributed to shareholders. As of December
31, 2021, the last tax return completed to date, the Trust has a net operating loss of $24.8 million, which may reduce or eliminate this
requirement.

As
of September 30, 2022, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $3,455,831 and incurred a net loss of $877,651 for nine months
ended September 30, 2022. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through September 30, 2022 is dependent upon improving the
profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing
will provide the additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due.

---

The
Company has financed its activities principally from support from a related party. The Company has incurred a net loss in every fiscal
period since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,767,885. The Company has
an accumulated deficit of $3,492,747 as of September 30, 2022. The Company anticipates operating losses to continue for the foreseeable
future due to, among other things, costs related to research funding, further development of its technology and products, and expenses
related to the commercialization of its products.

As we consolidate the licensees as VIEs, the amounts we earn or pay under the arrangements are eliminated in consolidation and the gross revenues of the stations are reported in our consolidated statements of operations. Our consolidated revenues include $40 million and $111 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $35 million and $107 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, related to the Cunningham Stations.

During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $112 million in continuing operations on pre-tax income of $380 million compared to $197 million on pre-tax income of $774 million during the three months ended September 30, 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $297 million in continuing operations on pre-tax income of $1.023 billion compared to $303 million on pre-tax income of $1.360 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Our provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods is calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. In calculating “ordinary” income, non‑taxable income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was deducted from pre-tax income.

---

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company generated pretax book income of $85.2 million related to its global operations and recorded a tax expense of $22.5 million. The tax expense for the period is above the US statutory tax rate.

---

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of $24 million which reflects income tax expense in countries where the Company is profitable, accrued withholding taxes, and the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and/or recognize expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions, including the United States ("U.S."), due to valuation allowances. Pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $16 million and $48 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate.

---

The Company recognized a net loss attributable to stockholders of $81.7 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared with  $69.7 million in the first nine months of 2021. The increase in net loss was primarily the result of the factors affecting the operating loss, higher interest expense, the absence of a $4.6 million gain related to the sale of the Company's preferred shares of OneH2, Inc. in the first nine months of 2021 and higher pension expense. The increase was partially offset by the absence a valuation allowance of $38.4 million provided against deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 5 of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Company's income tax provision.

In 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Incyte pursuant to which the Company is entitled to manufacture a portion of the global commercial supply needs for retifanlimab (Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement). Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement will expire upon the expiration of Incyte’s obligation to pay royalties under the Incyte License Agreement. The Company evaluated the Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement under ASC 606 and identified one performance obligation under the agreement: to perform services related to manufacturing the commercial supply of retifanlimab. The transaction price is based on a fixed price per batch of bulk drug substance to be manufactured and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The transaction price is being recognized using the input method reflecting the costs incurred (including resources consumed and labor costs incurred) related to the manufacturing services.  During the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized de minimis revenue and $1.4 million, respectively, for services performed under the Incyte Commercial Supply Agreement.

During 2019, the Company entered into two agreements under which the Company is to perform manufacturing services for Zai Lab’s clinical needs of margetuximab and tebotelimab (Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements). The Company evaluated the agreements under ASC 606 and determined that they should be accounted for as a single contract and identified two performance obligations within that contract: to perform services related to manufacturing the clinical supply of each of margetuximab and tebotelimab. The transaction price is based on the costs incurred to manufacture drug product and drug substance and is recognized over time as the services are provided, as the performance by the Company does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The transaction price is being recognized using the input method reflecting the costs incurred (including resources consumed and labor hours expended) related to the manufacturing service. No revenue was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2022, and $0.6 million was recognized related to the Zai Lab Clinical Supply Agreements during the three months ended September 30, 2021.

As of September 30, 2021, the Company had 537,731 options outstanding to acquire an equivalent number of shares of GWRI common stock. The 320,321 options outstanding from the 2017 option grant equated to 171,669 and 167,320 common share equivalents for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, which were included within the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The remaining 217,410 options outstanding from the 2019 option grant equated to 70,674 and 61,755 common share equivalents for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, which were included within the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, there were 74,164 restricted stock awards outstanding from the 2020 grant. The 74,164 restricted stock awards outstanding equated to 42,362 and 56,777 common share equivalents for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, which were included within the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, there were 143,800 restricted stock awards outstanding from the 2021 grant and equated to 20,472 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The 143,800 restricted stock awards outstanding from grant 2021 were not included within the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, as to do so would be antidilutive.  

---

Although basic earnings per share only considers shares of common stock outstanding during the period, the calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the following adjustments to weighted average common shares related to stock-based compensation plans: third quarter of 2022 and 2021 — 0.2 million and 0.4 million; first nine months of 2022 and 2021 — 0.2 million and 0.6 million.

Historically,
we have relied upon cash from financing activities to fund substantially all of the cash requirements of our activities and have
incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flow. The Company had net losses from continuing operations of $6,913,539,
and $6,977,481,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We cannot predict if we will be profitable. We may continue to
incur losses for an indeterminate period of time and may be unable to achieve profitability. An extended period of losses and
negative cash flow may prevent us from successfully operating and expanding our business. We may be unable to achieve or sustain
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. On September 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $451,212,
a working capital deficit of approximately $4.8
million, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $54
million.

Farms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $43.7 million (67.8%) and $10.8 million (16.8%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.  Though we seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible, should an unexpected natural disaster (such as an earthquake, wildfire, or flood) occur or climate change impact the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial performance and ability to continue operations.  None of our farms in California or Florida have been materially impacted by the recent wildfires or hurricanes that occurred in those respective regions.  In addition, with respect to the ongoing drought taking place in the western U.S., all of our farms in the region have independent (and, in most cases, multiple) sources of water, in addition to rainfall, and have not been materially impacted by the current drought conditions.  No other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of our total lease revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was 5.5% on $17.0 million of income before taxes compared to 4.8% on $23.2 million of income before taxes for the same period in 2021. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 12.8% on $55.4 million of income before taxes compared to 7.5% on $78.9 million of income before taxes for the same period of 2021.  The difference between the Company’s effective tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 and 2021 is due principally to the net impact of the Company’s earnings outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates that differ from the U.S federal rate, the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) deduction, the availability of tax credits, and the recognition of certain discrete tax items. 

---

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company's income tax expense was $0.8 million on a pre-tax income of $2.9 million. This compares to an income tax benefit of $3.5 million on a pre-tax loss of $16.6 million, which included certain non-deductible expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2021.

---

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company's income tax expense was $6.0 million on a pre-tax loss of $6.4 million. Income tax expense in the first nine months of 2022 was negatively impacted by valuation allowances recorded against U.S. tax assets as well as certain non-deductible expenses and discrete tax items. This compares to an income tax benefit of $9.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $53.2 million, which included certain non-deductible expenses and discrete tax items, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

The
Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. For the nine months ended September
30, 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $7.7 million and an accumulated deficit of $29.0 million and does not expect to generate
positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to incur significant and increasing losses until regulatory
approval is granted for its first product candidate, RenovoGem™. Regulatory approval is not guaranteed and may never be obtained.
The Company believes it will be able to raise additional capital through debt financings, private or public equity financings, license
agreements, collaborative agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources of financing. There can be no assurance
that such financing will be available or will be at terms acceptable to the Company. The inability to raise capital as and when needed
would have a negative impact on the Company’s liquidity, financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The
Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so.

---

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 11,592,699 and 11,651,811 common shares held in a grantor trust as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.

of $14,565,190. As of September 30, 2022 our unrestricted cryptocurrency balance was reported at a cost basis of $2,872,589. Management
does not believe there are any liquidity issues as of September 30, 2022.

The Company has incurred net losses of $13.2 million and $13.4 million
for the nine-month period ended September 24, 2022 and for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, respectively, and net cash outflows
from operations of $15.6 million and $10.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 24, 2022 and for the fiscal year ended December
25, 2021, respectively. The Company’s net cash outflows from operations were partially a result of funding its ongoing investments
in research and development, which management believes will continue and production inefficiencies resulting from intermittent supply
chain disruptions. These factors initially raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s
plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include operational improvements being implemented and the curtailment
of certain development programs, both of which are expected to preserve cash. Management estimates the Company will have sufficient liquidity
to fund operations at least through the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company has in the past sold equity securities through at-the-market
equity offerings and in the traditional fashion of significant equity offerings. Nonetheless, management monitors the capital markets
on an ongoing basis and may consider raising capital if favorable market conditions develop. If the Company’s actual results are
less than projected or the Company needs to raise capital for additional liquidity, the Company may be required to do additional equity
financings, reduce expenses, or enter into a strategic transaction. However, management can make no assurance that the Company will be
able to raise additional capital, reduce expenses sufficiently, or enter into a strategic transaction on terms acceptable to the Company,
or at all.

– During the third quarter of 2022, the Company identified an error in the calculation of the Company’s tax provision which understated
              income tax expense for previously reported financial statements. The error was related to an incorrect application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits tax deductions relating to executive compensation of certain
              executives of publicly held companies. The Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment during the third quarter of 2022 to correct the previously understated income tax expense.

The Company has concluded that these amounts would not have been material to its net income for the 12 months
              ended December 31, 2021, or to its expected net income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, as applicable, were based on 4.9 million and 5.7 million of such awards, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, as applicable, were based on 5.0 million and 5.9 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $5.9 million on pre-tax income of $10.1 million primarily due to an increase in valuation allowance, non-deductible expenses, foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, state taxes and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, all of which were partially offset by U.S. general business credits.

---

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $7.7 million on pre-tax income of $20.1 million primarily due to non-deductible expenses, an increase in valuation allowance, foreign taxes net of federal income tax benefits, an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and state taxes, all of which were partially offset by U.S. general business credits and recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. The net increase in valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets is primarily due to an increase in the Company's federal interest expense limitation carryover and the possibility that the net interest expense may be further limited in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance increase is partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance for the estimated use of U.S. general business credits and state net operating losses. As of September 30, 2022, the Company remains in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. However, it is possible that the Company could be out of its current three-year cumulative loss position within the next 12 months. The Company will maintain a valuation allowance on applicable deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of any or all of these valuation allowances. The Company continues to analyze the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, the valuation allowance could be reduced if there is sufficient evidence indicating it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change based on the level of profitability achieved.

The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities, and manufacturing  products for use in food, beverages, feed, energy, and industrial applications, and ingredients and solutions for human and animal nutrition.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer.  The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less.  The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the mode of transportation moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606.  The Company recognized revenue from transportation service contracts of $818 million, $606 million, and $423 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20.

Brighthouse Services currently provides the Company certain services which include, but are not limited to, treasury, financial planning and analysis, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit, financial reporting and information technology. When specific identification to a particular legal entity and/or product is not practicable, an allocation methodology based on various performance measures or activity-based costing, such as sales, new policies/contracts issued, reserves, and in-force policy counts is used. The bases for such charges are modified and adjusted by management when necessary or appropriate to reflect fairly and equitably the actual incidence of cost incurred by the Company and/or affiliate. Management believes that the methods used to allocate expenses under these arrangements are reasonable. Revenues received from an affiliate related to these agreements, recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees, were $193 million, $235 million and $213 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares of common stock. Certain restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, are considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested shares of our restricted stock do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Vested RSUs (for which shares of common stock have not yet been delivered) are included in the calculations of basic net loss per share. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

The accounting policies of each segment are the same as those followed by the company as a whole. Intersegment sales and transfers are priced as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Accordingly, the ECS segment records intersegment revenue and manufacturing profit on hardware and software shipments to customers under contracts of other segments. These segments, in turn, record customer revenue and marketing profits on such shipments of company hardware and software to customers.  In the company’s consolidated statements of income (loss), the manufacturing costs of products sourced from the ECS segment and sold to other segments’ customers are reported in cost of revenue for these other segments. Also included in the ECS segment’s sales and gross profit are sales of hardware and software sold to other segments for internal use in their engagements. The amount of such profit included in gross profit of the ECS segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The sales and profit on these transactions is eliminated in consolidation.

The Company evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution, as presented in the table below, is defined as operating income or loss excluding certain Cost of services and product development expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Depreciation, Amortization of intangibles, and Acquisition and integration charges. Certain bonus and fringe benefit costs included in consolidated Cost of services and product development are not allocated to segment expense. The accounting policies used by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the Company. There are no intersegment revenues. The Company does not identify or allocate tangible assets, including capital expenditures, by reportable segment. Accordingly, tangible assets are not reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of segment performance or in making decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

In the year ended January 2, 2022, our income tax provision of $7.3 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $13.2 million was primarily due to deferred tax liability related to mark-to-market unrealized gains on equity investments and state taxes on the sale of investments, partially offset by the benefit from stock-based compensation windfall deduction and true-up of prior year estimated state tax liability. In the year ended January 3, 2021, our income tax provision of $57.7 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $656.9 million was primarily due to state tax expenses arising from the taxable gains related to the Spin-Off transaction, withholding taxes from foreign dividend distributions, sale of equity investments, and deferred tax liability related to mark-to-market unrealized gain on equity investments.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2022 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from four years to five years and for our networking equipment from five years to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022, based on servers and networking equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2021 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $3.6 billion and a benefit to net loss of $2.8 billion, or $0.28 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share.

We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. Changes in historical and anticipated viewing patterns are lengthening the weighted average life of our capitalized video content. We anticipate the changes in viewing patterns will positively impact 2023 operating income by approximately $1.0 billion, generally ratably throughout the year.

The cash received from the settlement of these swaps of $3,820 was classified in investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. In the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined it had incorrectly recognized the net gain in the consolidated statement of operations and reclassified the net gain of $3,716 to other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax and accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Under DTE Electric’s and Consumers Energy’s current rate structure, DTE Electric and Consumers Energy include in their retail rates the actual cost of transmission services provided by ITCTransmission and METC, respectively, in their billings to their customers, effectively passing through to end-use consumers the total cost of transmission service. IP&L currently includes in their retail rates an allowance for transmission services provided by ITC Midwest in their billings to their customers. However, any financial difficulties experienced by DTE Electric, Consumers Energy or IP&L may affect their ability to make payments for transmission service to ITCTransmission, METC, and ITC Midwest, which could negatively impact our business. MISO, as our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ billing agent, bills DTE Electric, Consumers Energy, IP&L and other customers on a monthly basis and collects fees for the use of the MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ transmission systems.

Specifically, MISO and SPP require a letter of credit or cash deposit equal to the credit exposure, which is determined by a credit scoring model and other factors, from any customer using a member’s transmission system.

The license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, event-based milestone payments, sales-based royalty payments, or some combination of these. The event-based milestone payments represent variable consideration and we use the most likely amount method to estimate this variable consideration. Given the high degree of uncertainly around the achievement of these milestones, we do not recognize revenue from these milestone payments until the uncertainty associated with these payments is resolved. We currently estimate variable consideration related to milestone payments to be zero and, as such, no revenue has been recognized for milestone payments. We recognize revenue from sales-based royalty payments when or as the sales occur. On a quarterly basis, we re-evaluate our estimate of milestone variable consideration to determine whether any amount should be included in the transaction price and recorded in revenue prospectively.

The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other companies conducting high-risk, early-stage research and development of therapeutic product candidates. Principal among these risks are dependence on key individuals and intellectual property, competition from other products and companies, and the technical risks associated with the successful research, development, and clinical manufacturing of its therapeutic product candidates. Additionally, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a loss from continuing operations of $79,777 and, as of December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $1,868,567.

In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development, obtain regulatory approval of its therapeutics product candidates, successfully

Net income (loss) of foreign subsidiaries was $5.8 million, $3.7 million, and $(55.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Generally, it has been the Company's practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As previously noted, the Tax Act made significant changes to the taxation of undistributed earnings, requiring that all previously untaxed earnings and profits of the Company's controlled foreign operations be subjected to the transition tax. Since these earnings have now been subjected to U.S. federal tax, they would only be potentially subject to limited other taxes, including foreign withholding and certain state taxes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for foreign withholdings and state taxes on its undistributed international earnings or losses of its foreign subsidiaries since it intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the United States. The Company has estimated that the amount of the unrecorded deferred tax liability related to undistributed international earnings is approximately $1.8 million.

During the first quarter of 2020, the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by the OPEC+ countries caused oil and gas commodity demand to decrease significantly. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the current regulatory environment, depressed oil and gas commodity price and demand and the resulting 30% decrease in average active United States oil rig count during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, which is historically our largest revenue quarter, led to a slight decrease in revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended  December 31, 2020.

September 4, 2018, the Company entered into a development, license and supply agreement with OS Therapies (“OST”) for
the use of ADXS31-164, also known as ADXS-HER2, for evaluation in the treatment of osteosarcoma in humans. Under the terms of the
license agreement, as amended, OST is responsible for the conduct and funding of a clinical study evaluating ADXS-HER2 in
recurrent, completely resected osteosarcoma. Under the most recent amendment to the licensing agreement, OST agreed to pay New Ayala
$25,000
per month (“Monthly Payment”) starting on April 30, 2020 until OST achieves its funding milestone of $2,337,500.

enter negotiations with the University of Pennsylvania to establish a licensing agreement for ADXS31-164 to OST for clinical and
commercial development of the ADXS31-164 technology.

Since
OST is making $25,000 monthly payments that will be creditable against the $1,550,000, as well as additional upfront payments not specified

the Company will defer any of the monthly payments until the IP and licensing rights are transferred to OST. However, if OST terminates
the contract, which they are able to do with 60-day notice, the Company would recognize any of the payments received when the contract
terminates.

The
Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. For the year ended December 31,
2022, the Company reported a net loss of $9.9 million and an accumulated deficit of $31.2 million and does not expect to generate positive
cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to incur significant and increasing losses until regulatory
approval is granted for its first product candidate, RenovoGem™. Regulatory approval is not guaranteed and may never be obtained.
The Company believes it will be able to raise additional capital through debt financings, private or public equity financings, license
agreements, collaborative agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources of financing. There can be no assurance
that such financing will be available or will be at terms acceptable to the Company. The inability to raise capital as and when needed
would have a negative impact on the Company’s liquidity financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The
Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred substantial operating losses in the years
ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 primarily due to reduced gross margins caused by a combination of competitors’ introduction
of newer products with more advanced features together with significant price cutting of their products and the recent acquisitions with
much smaller margins than the video solutions segment, historically. The Company incurred operating losses of approximately $29.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $14.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and it had an accumulated deficit of $92.0
million as of December 31, 2022. In recent years the Company has accessed the public and private capital markets to raise funding through
the issuance of debt and equity. In that regard, the Company raised approximately $66.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 through
two underwritten public offerings. These equity raises were utilized to fund its operations and acquisitions. Management expects to continue
this pattern until it achieves positive cash flows from operations, although it can offer no assurance in this regard.

The Company has recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of approximately $192.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management has projected that cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations beyond the next 12 months based on our hashing rate at December 31, 2022, if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. We require additional capital and if we are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company currently estimates that the January 1, 2021 transition date impact from adoption will result in a decrease in AOCI of $499.3 million. This is due primarily to updating the LFPB discount rate assumptions previously locked-in for reserves held at the transition date to rates determined by reference to the transition date market level yields for upper-medium-grade (low credit risk) fixed income instruments as of December 31, 2020. The Company had five cohorts where the net premium ratio was capped at 100% at the transition date, resulting in a reduction to retained earnings of $0.2 million. The Company estimates the effect from adoption because of the update of underlying assumptions, including the removal of the provision for adverse deviation, will increase income after-tax by $7 million to $17 million and $15 million to $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

---

The Company currently estimates that the January 1, 2021 transition date impact from adoption will result in an increase in AOCI of $71.5 million. This is due to the removal of amounts previously recognized in AOCI (shadow DAC adjustments). The Company estimates the effect of amortizing on a constant-level basis over the expected term of the related contracts will increase income after-tax by $8 million to $10 million and $3 million to $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In June 2022, the Company recorded adjustments to revenue related to changes in estimates in connection with the Collaboration and License Agreement, entered into in 2019 and amended in June 2020 and December 2021 (“GSK Agreement”) with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property (No. 5) Limited and Glaxo Group Limited (together, “GSK”).  These changes in estimates were driven by the mutual agreement to conclude certain research activities in June 2022 and GSK’s termination of the GSK Agreement, effective December 24, 2022, both of which resulted in changes to the measure of proportional cumulative performance. These adjustments increased revenue by $83.6 million, decreased net loss by $83.6 million and resulted in a $0.34 reduction in the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended

The Company recorded a net loss of $54.2 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, expects to incur losses in subsequent periods for at least the next several years, and is highly dependent on its ability to find additional sources of funding through either equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing agreements or a combination of any such transactions. Management believes that the Company’s existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund its current operating plans through at least 12 months from the date of filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adequate additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate research and development programs, or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that the Company might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

The Company has one operating segment which is specialty pharmaceutical products. Management has chosen to organize the Company based on the type of products sold. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company, which uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, evaluated that our specialty pharmaceutical products compete in similar economic markets and similar circumstances.  Substantially all of the Company’s assets are located in the United States. Total revenues are primarily attributable to U.S. customers.  Net revenues from customers outside the United States were approximately $1.5 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Since inception, the Company has funded operations primarily through private and public placements of its equity, debt and warrants and through fees, cost reimbursements and payments received from its licensees. The Company commenced generating product revenues related to sales of AMZEEQ and ZILXI in January 2020 and October 2020, respectively. AMZEEQ and ZILXI were sold as part of the sale of the MST Franchise on January 12, 2022 and, as such, the Company no longer generates revenue from the sale of these products. The Company has incurred losses and experienced negative operating cash flows since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur losses until such a time when its product candidates, if approved, are commercially successful, if at all. The Company will not generate any revenue from any current or future product candidates unless and until it obtains regulatory approval and commercializes such products. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $23.2 million and used $29.2 million of cash in operations. The net loss was comprised of $10.7 million of income from discontinued operations and $33.9 million loss from continuing operations.

Following the closing of a qualified financing (as such term is defined in the Abbisko Agreement), Abbisko was required to pay the Company a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable financial milestone payment of $3.0 million. Abbisko achieved such qualified financing in March 2020 and, as a result, the Company was eligible to receive the milestone payment, which was received by the Company in April 2020. The Company is also eligible to receive potential development and regulatory milestone payments, which vary based on the number of indications developed, and potential commercial milestone payments based on annual net sales of mavorixafor-based licensed products.

---

Upon entering into the Abbisko Agreement, the Company evaluated the Abbisko Agreement under ASC 606 and determined the Abbisko Agreement contained a single performance obligation related to the exclusive license to develop and commercialize mavorixafor and the transfer of know-how that was satisfied at the inception of the arrangement. The transaction price related to the transfer of the license and know-how was fully constrained and the Company ascribed no transaction price to the development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the “most-likely amount” method. The Company concluded that any consideration related to the initial transfer of the license and know-how will be recognized when it is probable that Abbisko will achieve the related financial milestone and other operational milestones. Any consideration related to sales-based milestones (including royalties) will be recognized when the related sales occur as these amounts have been determined to relate predominantly to the license granted to Abbisko and therefore are recognized at the later of when the performance obligation is satisfied or the related sales occur. As a result of Abbisko’s achievement of the qualified financing, the Company reversed the constraint related to this milestone and recognized $3.0 million of license revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Significant customers are those which represent more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue or accounts receivable balance at each balance sheet date. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. These customers each represented $7 million to $8 million of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in aggregate, accounted for 27% of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had four customers that accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable. In aggregate, these customers represented 65% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenue or accounts receivable. Based on the nature of third party partners, the Company does not anticipate any collectability issues with these receivables and closely monitors the outstanding receivables for payment within agreed upon time periods.

The excess purchase consideration over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill arising from the acquisition is largely attributable to expanding our copy and editorial talent base and synergies which we expect to achieve from cross-marketing and providing complementary products to our existing and acquired customers and is fully expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The acquired intangible assets related to the Buttonwood Publishing transaction are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Accordingly, tradenames will be amortized over 9.0 years and customer relationships will be amortized over 6.5 years. Amortization for the acquired intangible assets was $632 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue from Buttonwood Publishing was $1,961 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company analyzed its virtual currency deferred revenue balance to determine the likelihood of redemption based on the actual redemption rate. Virtual currency is paid for upfront and is recorded as deferred revenue until the currency is redeemed, at which point the Company recognizes the revenue. The Company's analysis showed a likelihood of redemption of its virtual currency after 12 months of purchase is remote. Based on this analysis, starting in September 2022, the Company recognized revenue on a quarterly basis for all virtual currency that is held for longer than 12 months. This change is considered a change in accounting estimate in accordance with ASC 250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”. The effect of the change in estimate increased the Company's revenue by $2.5 million, decreased the net loss by $2.3 million, and decreased both the basic and diluted loss per share by $0.87 for 2022.

The Company's potential dilutive shares consist of 10,982,805 shares of Appgate’s common stock underlying the Convertible Senior Notes that is convertible at any time at the option of the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes prior to their maturity - see Note 11. These potentially dilutive shares have been excluded from diluted (loss) income per share for 2021 as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share and have an anti-dilutive effect. Therefore, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same in 2021.

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $5,967,000, $1,440,000 and $9,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.

Our
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, we reported revenue of $3,866,539 and an accumulated deficit of $4,643,217 as of December 31, 2022. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to
raise additional debt or equity funding to meet our ongoing operating expenses and ultimately in merging with another entity with experienced
management and profitable operations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in achieving these objectives.

The Company is in the early stages of exploration and as is common with any exploration company, it raises financing for its acquisition activities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will continue operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a loss of $3,660,382 for the year ended July 31, 2023 and has accumulated a deficit of $26,668,986.

To the extent the Company maintains a controlling financial interest in an alliance, the alliance’s financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company and the related processing fees are treated as an intercompany transaction and eliminated in consolidation. To the extent the Company has significant influence in, but not control of, an alliance, the Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in the alliance. As a result, the processing and other service fees charged to merchant alliances accounted for under the equity method are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income primarily as processing and services revenue. Such fees totaled $45 million and $46 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $91 million and $93 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No directors or officers of the Company have ownership interests in any of the alliances. The formation of each of these alliances generally involves the Company and the financial institution contributing contracts with merchants to the alliance and a cash payment from one owner to the other to achieve the desired ownership percentage for each. The Company and the financial institution enter into a long-term processing service agreement, which governs the Company’s provision of transaction processing services to the alliance. The Company had approximately $36 million and $43 million of amounts due from unconsolidated merchant alliances included within trade accounts receivable, net in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

For
the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $6.9 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had
negative cash flow from operating activities of $6.1 million. The Company plans to fund its cash flow needs through current cash on hand
and future debt and/or equity financings which it may obtain through one or more public or private equity offerings, debt financings,
government or other third-party funding, strategic alliances, or collaboration agreements. If the Company is unable to obtain funding,
the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its projects and services which could adversely affect its future business
prospects and its ability to continue as a going concern. While there are indicators of substantial doubt, the Company believes that
its current available cash on hand plus additional sources of funding, including current customer contracts as well as the Company’s
ability to raise additional capital through the Company’s issuance of Class A common stock. These alleviated the substantial doubt,
and we believe the Company will be sufficiently funded to meet its planned expenditures and to meet the Company’s obligations for
at least the one-year period following its consolidated financial statement issuance date.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as applicable, were based on 4.1 million and 4.9 million of such awards, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as applicable, were based on 4.1 million and 5.0 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $962,000 and $1,498,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $1,888,000 and $2,988,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $426,789
and $0
for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company
generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and
classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that the Company will become
commercially viable without additional financing, the availability and terms of which are uncertain. If the Company cannot secure
necessary capital when needed on commercially reasonable terms, its business, condition (financial and otherwise) and commercial
viability may be harmed. Although management believes that it will be able to successfully execute its business plan, which includes
third party financing and the raising of capital to meet the Company’s future liquidity needs, there can be no assurances in
this regard. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The
unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue
in operation for the foreseeable future and which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal
course of business. However, management has identified the following conditions and events that created an uncertainty about the ability

of $44.2 million, a loss from operations of $3.0 million and used $3.0 million to fund operations. These factors among others raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company’s tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $49.4 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 11,416,856 and 11,592,699 common shares held in a grantor trust as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-40, Going Concern, the Company evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

as a result of our net loss. The principal reason for our loss for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was reduced revenue and higher
material costs. Management is developing plans to ensure that we have the working capital necessary to fund operations. We will increase
our pricing on products to mitigate our higher material costs. Management concludes that it is probable that our cash resources and line
of credit will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for twelve months from the issuance of the condensed financial statements.
Therefore, the accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.

During the first quarter of 2023, management determined that its prior treatment of property taxes in those instances where the Company was responsible for paying property taxes and subsequently seeking tenant reimbursement should be treated differently than those instances where property taxes were paid directly by tenants to taxing authorities. Management determined that property taxes paid directly by tenants to taxing authorities should not have been recorded in the Company’s accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the prior year periods in accordance with ASU 2018-20 “Leases (Topic 842) - Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors.” Accordingly, the Company’s accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 reflect an adjustment to reduce rental income and a corresponding reduction in property expenses of $531,670 and $1,136,397, respectively, for such property taxes and the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 reflects a reduction in tenant receivables with a corresponding reduction in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $1,596,127.

Accordingly, the Company’s accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 reflect an increase in rental income and a corresponding reduction in the gain on sale of real estate investments of $282,030 and $807,721, respectively.

Company determined the Georgia JV is a VIE, and that the Company is its primary beneficiary because the Company has an obligation to
absorb losses that are potentially significant and the Company controls the majority of the activities that impact the Georgia JV’s
economic performance, specifically control of the INVOcell and lab services quality management. As a result, the Company consolidated
the Georgia JV’s results with its own. As of June 30, 2023, the Company invested $0.9 million in the Georgia JV in the form of
capital contributions as well as $0.5 million in the form of a note. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Georgia JV

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP in the United States of America, assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company
incurred losses from operations of $253,858 and $53,884, respectively. The Company had a working capital deficit of $3,124,886 as of
June 30, 2023. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise the additional capital to meet short and long-term operating
requirements. Management is continuing to pursue external financing alternatives to improve the Company’s working capital position
however additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary
capital, the Company may have to cease operations.

As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant recurring losses but has positive cash flows from operations for the current year. Although the Company has experienced net losses of $10.3 million and $2.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, net cash flows provided by operating activities improved to $2.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, from $7.2 million used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund its ongoing operations. The Company's future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to generate enough revenue or raise capital to support its operations.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, considering the Company’s working capital (including restricted cash) of $12.0 million as of June 30, 2023, historical losses (during the year ended March 31, 2023 and three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s net loss was $30.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively), and future expected losses, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. Although the Company completed a rights offering of common stock in August 2023, the $7.9 million in gross proceeds that the Company received from such offering did not alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.

Beginning on August 1, 2023, the total annual fixed rent for the Master Lease Properties (Annual Base Rent) will be $65.0 million, escalating by 10% every five years. The Master Lease is a triple-net lease, and therefore, Annual Base Rent does not include taxes, insurance, utilities, common area maintenance and ground lease rent, for which Regal will be responsible for paying separately. Due to Regal's expected significantly improved credit profile, continuing box office recovery and Regal's payment history, among other factors, the Company will recognize revenue related to the Master Lease on an accrual basis beginning on the Effective Date.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”), assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had
a net loss available for common stockholders of approximately $2,703,000. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of approximately $170,237,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $8,781,000. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, within one year from the issuance date of this filing. The Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise the required additional capital or debt financing to meet
short and long-term operating requirements. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company received net cash proceeds of approximately
$1,299,000 from the sale of common shares (See Note 8). Subsequent to period end, the Company received $140,000 proceeds from the issuance
of promissory notes, related parties (See Note 12).

During the six-month period ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of $27 million which reflects income tax expense in countries where the Company is profitable, accrued withholding taxes, and the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and/or recognize expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions, including the United States ("U.S."), due to valuation allowances. Pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $20 million and $13 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $8,416 and used
cash in continuing operations of $4,685. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date of the financial statements being issued. As a result, the Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional
financing until the Company can generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations. The Company intends to continue
to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue its operations.

---

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded out of period adjustment resulting in a decrease of $5 million to Income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes.

The error was not material to any prior period.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at June 30, 2023 and 2022, is considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

The cost-to-cost method of accounting requires the Company to make estimates about the expected revenue and gross profit on each of its contracts in process. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 1.3%, which resulted in decreases in operating income of $11.5 million, net income of $8.0 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.48.

The Company currently does not have access to capital through a line of credit nor other readily available sources of capital, other than available additional advances up to $500 thousand under a Security Agreement and Promissory Note with Mark Burish. Together, these factors raise the need to consider the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Current trends in hydraulic fracturing equipment operating conditions such as larger pads, changes to job design and increased pumping hours per day have resulted in shorter useful lives for certain critical components that are included in our property and equipment assets. These recent trends necessitated a review of useful lives of our critical components like fluid ends, power ends, hydraulic fracturing units and other components in the first quarter of 2023. We determined that the estimated useful life of fluid ends is now less than one year, resulting in our determination that costs associated with the replacement of these components will no longer be capitalized, but instead recorded in inventories and amortized to cost of services over their estimated useful life. We have also shortened the estimated useful lives of power ends to two years from five years and hydraulic fracturing units to ten years from fifteen years. This change in accounting estimates was made effective January 1, 2023 and accounted for prospectively. The net effect of this change for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was a $3.9 million and $7.3 million decrease in net income, or $0.03 and $0.06 per basic and diluted share, respectively.

In addition, the Company has issued $75 million aggregate principal amount of Notes on January 24, 2023, which, if converted, would result in the issuance of a maximum of 2,124,645 shares of common stock. These shares were excluded from the dilutive calculations, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company completed its annual assessment of the useful lives of its property, plant and equipment.

This  change in accounting estimate was effective beginning January 1, 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property, plant and equipment-net in the company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate was an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of $57 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2023, and $131 million, or $0.12 and $0.11 per basic and diluted share, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Due to our financial performance as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, including net losses of $2.5 million  for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and $10.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and total cash used in operating activities of  $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and $6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we determined that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern continues to exist at June 30, 2023. As a result of restructuring actions and initiatives, we have tailored our operating expenses to be more in line with our expected sales volumes; however, we continue to incur losses and have a substantial accumulated deficit.

For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s income tax provision totaled $27.4 million and $15.2 million, respectively, on a net income before income taxes of $184.6 million and $92.2 million, respectively.

For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the income tax provision was calculated using the annualized effective tax rate method and was primarily due to projected tax expense in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that are profitable, partially offset by a tax deduction from employee stock compensation reported as a discrete event.

Because the Company is included in the tax filings of other Dell entities, management has determined that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets.  If the Company becomes ineligible for inclusion in the Dell Technologies consolidated tax group, its ability to benefit from its losses and other tax attributes may be impaired resulting from the Company's need to file its own Federal and State tax returns without the ability to offset its losses against the profits from the parent. The Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that are currently recorded based on the tax sharing agreement with Dell. Currently, net deferred tax assets are approximately $12.1 million. If the Company’s tax provision had been prepared using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma pre-tax loss, tax expense and net loss for the six months ended August 4, 2023 would have been $(79.9) million, $1.2 million and $(81.1) million, respectively, as a result of the recognition of a valuation allowance that would have been recorded on a significant amount of deferred tax assets as well as certain attributes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that would be lost if not utilized by the Dell consolidated group.

Beginning in fiscal year 2023, to align the presentation of revenue with the manner in which management reviews such information, the presentation of "products" and "services and other" revenue and "costs and expenses" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations were reclassified to move revenue and costs and expenses primarily related to bundled licenses and technical support services from "products" to "services and other." This resulted in reclassification of $24 million and $64 million, respectively, from "products" revenue to "services and other" revenue for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, and $2 million and $7 million, respectively, from "cost of products" to "cost of services and other" for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 to conform to the current presentation. This change had no impact on reported total revenue, income from operations and net income in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

We recognize revenue and estimate deferred revenue based on the cost of development service incurred over the total estimated cost of development services to be provided for the development period. For revenue recognition purposes, the development period is estimated to be completed in 2026. It is possible that this period will change and is assessed at each reporting date. ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) requires that an entity include a constraint on the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is considered “constrained” if there is a potential for significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. As part of the constraint evaluation, we considered numerous factors, including a potential shift in certain responsibilities between the two parties which would result in changes to the net cost sharing payments, for which outcomes are difficult to predict as of the date of this Report. As a result, no collaboration revenue is recognized from the biosimilar program for the six months ended June 30, 2023. We will continue to evaluate the variable transaction price and related revenue recognition in each reporting period and as the above uncertainties are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized no revenue related to development services under the Viatris Agreement. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recognized $1.7 million and $5.2 million related to the development services under the Viatris Agreement, respectively.

In October 2022, the Company completed the sale of its storage tank business for $275 million. Net cash proceeds received at closing were approximately $271.6 million, after transaction closing costs. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $189.0 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. An additional gain of $6.4 million was recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the resolution of certain contingencies from the sale. The storage tanks business, historically reported within the Engineered Structures segment as continuing operations until the date of sale, is a leading manufacturer of steel pressure tanks for the storage and transportation of propane, ammonia, and other gases serving the residential, commercial, energy, and agricultural markets with operations in the U.S. and Mexico.

During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company generated pre-tax book income of $25.0 million related to its global operations and recorded a tax expense of $6.4 million. The tax expense for the period is above the US statutory tax rate.  Significant items impacting the quarterly tax provision include: tax charges associated with non-deductible executive compensation under IRC Section 162(m) and non-deductible interest expense in the United Kingdom.  During this period, the Company's net deferred tax asset (and associated valuation allowance) related to its excess tax basis in legacy UK real estate assets decreased as a result of KWE realizing higher tax losses than book losses on the disposition of real estate and from book unrealized foreign currency gains and fair value gains not recognized for tax.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of June 30, 2023 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. Additionally, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $43,053 and, as of June 30, 2023, had an accumulated deficit of $1,911,620. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development (which could occur through debt or equity issuances, sales or partnerships of non-core assets, collaborations or out-licensing of core or non-core assets, or other transactions), obtain regulatory approval of its therapeutic product candidates, successfully commercialize its therapeutic product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company changed its stock-based compensation policy for recognizing expense for graded vesting awards with only service conditions from the accelerated attribution method to the straight-line attribution method. The Company believes the straight-line attribution method for stock-based compensation expense for awards solely subject to time-based vesting conditions is the preferable accounting policy in accordance with ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, because it more accurately reflects how the award is earned over the service period and is the predominant method used in its industry. The Company applied the change retrospectively adjusting all periods presented resulting in an increase to net loss of $9.3 million and an increase to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.03 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and a decrease to net loss of $7.0 million and a decrease to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.02 for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Our
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the period
ended June 30, 2023, we reported revenue of $380,932 and an accumulated deficit of $3,898,313 as of June 30, 2023. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise
additional debt or equity funding to meet our ongoing operating expenses and ultimately in merging with another entity with experienced
management and profitable operations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in achieving these objectives.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had
a net loss of $1,791,131 The Company has also incurred cumulative net losses of $38,789,179 since its inception and requires capital
for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. These factors, among others, raises substantial doubt about

In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our network equipment and concluded to adjust our estimate of the useful life of our network equipment from three to five years due to advances in technology and improvements in how we operate our network equipment. The effect of this change in estimate, effective January 1, 2023, was a reduction of $3,770 primarily in depreciation - network expense in cost of services within our consolidated statement of operations, an increase of net income by approximately $3,601, and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.02, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Management
does not expect existing cash as of June 30, 2023, to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months
from the issuance date of these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumed
the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2023,
the Company has incurred losses totaling $18.8 million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue from operations, and will
require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to finance operating
costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital through equity offerings,
debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Net income increased $2.9 million to $67.0 million, or $0.65 per share, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to net income of $64.1 million, or $0.59 per share, for the same period in 2022. The increase during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily attributable to lower total expenses, owed to a decrease in acquisition related expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2023. Lower expenses were partially offset by a decline in net interest income and an increase in provision for credit losses. Net income increased $92.6 million to $123.3 million, or $1.19 per share during the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to net income of $30.7 million, or $0.30 per share for the same period in 2022. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income, a decrease in acquisition related expenses of $111.0 million, and a reduction of provision for loan losses of $32.7 million largely related to the non-PCD provision expense in 2022 associated with the GWB acquisition. These impacts were partially offset by increases in operating expenses as a result of the GWB acquisition, losses on the sale of investment securities, and income tax expense.

date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded
assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to implement its business plan and
continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company is actively seeking investor funding.

The Company has recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of approximately $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Management has projected that based on our hashing rate at June 30, 2023, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations beyond the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. We require additional capital and if we are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 11,416,856 and 11,592,699 common shares held in a grantor trust as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.

Pretax losses in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are maintained and no income tax benefits are recognized totaled $11 million and $10 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively, resulting in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate in those years.

During the first quarter of 2023 with the transition to a new independent registered public accounting firm, management determined that its prior treatment of property taxes in those instances where the Company was responsible for paying property taxes and subsequently seeking tenant reimbursement should be treated differently than those instances where property taxes were paid directly by tenants to taxing authorities. After a thorough review, management determined that property taxes paid directly by tenants to taxing authorities should have not been recorded in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of 2022 in accordance with ASU 2018-20 “Leases (Topic 842) - Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors.” Accordingly, the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of 2022 reflects an adjustment to reduce rental income and a corresponding reduction in property expenses of $604,727 for such property taxes and the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 reflects a reduction in tenant receivables with a corresponding reduction in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $1,596,127. The corrections did not affect net loss or net loss per share of the first quarter of 2022 unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

---

During the fourth quarter of 2022, management determined that straight-line rents receivable write-offs associated with real estate investments previously sold should be reclassified as a component of the related gain on sale of the real estate investments rather than as an offset to rental income as previously presented in the Company's statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of 2022 reflects an increase in rental income and a corresponding reduction in the gain on sale of real estate investments of $525,691. The reclassification did not affect net loss or net loss per share of the first quarter of 2022 unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

The Company is in the early stages of exploration and, as is common with any exploration company, it raises financing for its acquisition activities. The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will continue operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a loss of $3,499,357 for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2023 and has accumulated a deficit of $26,507,962.

Since
inception, the Company’s activities have consisted primarily of performing research and development to advance its product
candidates. The Company is still in the development phase and has not been marketing any developed products to date. Since
inception, the Company has incurred losses, including a net loss of approximately $9.2
million for the nine months ended March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$54.7
million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses. The Company expects that its cash will be sufficient to fund
its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed
financial statements. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenue from sales of any current or
future product candidates, the Company expects to seek additional funding in order to reach its development and commercialization
objectives through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through collaboration, license and development
agreements. The Company may not be able to obtain funding or enter into collaboration, license or development agreements on
acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any funding may be dilutive to or adversely affect the rights of the Company’s
stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding on satisfactory terms, or at all, the Company could be forced to delay,
scale back or eliminate the development of its current or future product candidates or other business prospects.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. During periods of net income available to holders of Common Stock, the calculation of earnings per share excludes the income attributable to participating securities in the numerator and the dilutive impact of these securities from the denominator. In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, as applicable, were based on 4.2 million and 5.1 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

The
Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. For the three months ended March
31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss of $3.3 million and an accumulated deficit of $34.4 million and does not expect to generate
positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to incur significant and increasing losses for the
foreseeable future until regulatory approval is granted for its first product candidate, RenovoGem™. Regulatory approval is not
guaranteed and may never be obtained. The Company believes it will be able to raise additional capital through debt financings, private
or public equity financings, license agreements, collaborative agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources
of financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available or will be at terms acceptable to the Company. The inability
to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the Company’s liquidity, financial condition and its ability
to pursue its business strategy. The Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do
so.

Basic earnings per share of common stock are computed by dividing net earnings available to each class of common stockholders on an as if distributed basis by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share, by definition, reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock, that then shared in the distributed earnings of each class of common stock. U.S. GAAP requires a two-class presentation for the Company's two classes of common stock. The Company currently has no share-based compensation awards outstanding that could be redeemed for shares of common stock.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company did not carry an income tax provision amount as the Company does not recognize tax benefits from current year tax losses in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  The Company’s tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $16.8 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions due to the valuation allowance.  At March 31, 2023, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to amortization of the Notes.  The Company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as future realization of such assets is not more likely than not to occur.

The Company chose to adopt ASU 2023-02 because it felt that the proportional amortization method more accurately reflects the economic substance of its tax credit investment.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, adopting ASU 2023-02 increased net income $32.

This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net, in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended April 30, 2023, was a benefit of $2 million and $31 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively. This resulted in an increase in operating income of $33 million and net income of $28 million after tax, or $0.01 per both basic and diluted share.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-40, Going Concern, the Company evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

In November 2021, the Company began distributing and recognizing revenue from sales of Zokinvy (lonafarnib) through a reimbursed early access program in France. The Company recorded revenue of $0.5 million from sales of product under the ATU program for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 of $55 million relative to loss before income taxes of $282 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $35 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $176 million. The income tax benefit for the quarter is primarily the result of a deferred tax benefit resulting from the impairment of goodwill during the quarter and certain discrete income tax benefits. This income tax benefit was partially reduced by unfavorable permanent tax adjustments that were fixed and not impacted by the reduced pretax earnings. Discrete items recognized during the quarter include a favorable audit settlement and equity related compensation tax benefits. The quarterly provision was also impacted by the geographic distribution of the Company's pretax income resulting from our business mix, changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, special items, certain equity related compensation, and other discrete tax items that may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 of $19 million relative to loss before income taxes of $165 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 of $63 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $394 million. The current year income tax benefit is primarily the result of a deferred tax benefit resulting from the impairment of goodwill during the quarter and certain discrete income tax benefits that included a favorable audit settlement and equity related compensation benefits. This income tax benefit was partially offset by unfavorable permanent tax adjustments that were fixed and not impacted by the reduced pretax earnings and pretax losses in tax jurisdictions where the Company may not recognize a tax benefit. The nine-month provision was also impacted by changes in the geographic distribution of the Company's pretax income resulting from our business mix, the unfavorable impact of permanent differences, restructuring, special items, certain equity related compensation, and other discrete tax items that may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

Assuming the performance criteria had been achieved as of April 29, 2023, the incremental dilutive impact would have been 49,203 shares. There would have been no dilutive impact on shares assuming the performance criteria had been achieved as of April 30, 2022.

Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. The Company has loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and are generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Company recognized PIK and non-cash interest from investments of $9,023 and $8,523, respectively, and PIK and non-cash dividends from investments of $6,501 and $5,079, respectively.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of March 31, 2023 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. Additionally, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $22,734 and, as of March 31, 2023, had an accumulated deficit of $1,891,301. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development (which could occur through debt or equity issuances, sales or partnerships of non-core assets, collaborations or out-licensing of core or non-core assets, or other transactions), adequately satisfy or renegotiate debt obligations, obtain regulatory approval of its therapeutic product candidates, successfully commercialize its therapeutic product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

In late December 2022, the Company experienced a wide-scale operational disruption as historically extreme winter weather across a significant portion of the United States impacted its operational plan and flight schedules. Subsequent to Winter Storm Elliott, the Company was challenged to realign flight crews, flight schedules, and aircraft for a period of several days during this peak demand travel period. The Company returned to a normal operating schedule on December 30, 2022. This disruption and subsequent recovery efforts resulted in the cancellation of more than 16,700 flights during the period from December 21 through December 31, 2022. For first quarter 2023, these events also created a deceleration in bookings, primarily isolated to January and February 2023, as well as increased expenses of approximately $55 million, which are included in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These expenses included reimbursements to Customers impacted by the cancellations for costs they incurred in excess of the amounts accrued as of December 31, 2022, adjustments to the estimated value of Rapid Rewards points offered as a gesture of goodwill to Customers as a result of changes in the estimates of the points expected to be redeemed, and additional premium pay and additional compensation for Employees directly or indirectly impacted by the cancellations and recovery efforts. The financial impacts of the event to the Company also included the elimination of profitsharing expenses for the quarter. The continuing effects of this event significantly contributed to the Company recording a net loss for first quarter 2023 in the amount of $159 million.

The
Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 6% per annum, payable annually on the last day of December of each year. Dividends
shall accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative. Dividends are payable at the Company’s option either
in cash or “in kind” in shares of common stock; provided, however that dividends may only be paid in cash following the fiscal
year in which the Company has net income (as shown in its audited financial statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
such year) of at least $0.5 million. For “in-kind” dividends, holders will receive that number of shares of common stock

stock for the 90 trading days immediately preceding a dividend date (“VWAP”). For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
issued dividends of 460,093 shares of common stock at a VWAP of $0.33 per share. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company

---

Sales of Commercial Original Equipment increased $9.7 million, or 16.5%, to $68.4 million in 2023, reflecting strong demand from aircraft manufacturers as the industry aircraft build rates continue to recover from the COVID-19 related slowdown, partially offset by material availability constraints.

---

---

Sales of Process Valves and Related Products increased by $20.0 million, or 10.9%, to $202.9 million in 2023, reflecting an increase in core sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation as the euro weakened against the U.S. dollar. Sales growth was driven primarily by strength in the Chemical vertical.

---

Sales of Commercial Valves decreased by $67.6 million, or 68.8%, to $30.6 million in 2023, primarily driven by the impact of the divestiture of Crane Supply of $61.7 million, or 62.8%, and, to a lesser extent,  unfavorable foreign currency translation as the British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar.

The core sales decrease primarily reflected lower sales to the U.S. Government.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement

months ended March 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $226,860 and $675,796 of cash was provided by the Company’s operating

assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business.   The Company has financed its activities principally from
support from a related party. The Company has incurred a net loss in every fiscal period since inception. For the three months ended

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company identified an error in the calculation of the Company’s tax provision which understated income tax expense for previously reported financial statements. The error was related to an incorrect application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits tax deductions relating to executive compensation of certain executives of publicly held companies. The Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment during the third quarter of 2022 to correct the previously understated income tax expense. The adjustment resulted in a decrease to after-tax income of $(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact associated with this correction was not considered material to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2022, year ended December 31, 2022, or the financial statements of any previously filed interim or annual periods.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred losses from
operations of $90,971 and $28,370, respectively. The Company had a working capital deficit of $3,227,085 as of March 31, 2023. These
circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise the additional capital to meet short and long-term operating requirements.
Management is continuing to pursue external financing alternatives to improve the Company’s working capital position however additional
financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company
may have to cease operations.

Because the Company is included in the tax filings of other Dell entities, management has determined that it will be able to realize the remainder of its deferred tax assets. If the Company becomes ineligible for inclusion in the Dell Technologies consolidated tax group, its ability to benefit from its losses and other tax attributes may be impaired as it would need to file its own Federal and State tax returns without the ability to offset its losses against the profits from the parent. The Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that are currently recorded based on the tax sharing agreement with Dell. Currently, net deferred tax assets are approximately $5.9 million. If the Company’s tax provision had been prepared using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma pre-tax loss, tax benefit and net loss for the three months ended May 5, 2023 would have been $38.1 million, $1.0 million and $37.1 million, respectively, as a result of the recognition of a valuation allowance that would have been recorded on a significant amount of deferred tax assets as well as certain attributes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that would be lost if not utilized by the Dell consolidated group.

In accordance with the Company’s policies of determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and accounting for earnings per share, the net income (loss) per common share is adjusted for earnings distributed through declared dividends (if any) and allocated to all participating securities (weighted average common shares outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding) under the two-class method. Under this method, allocations were made to 373,985 and 303,666 of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

---

The Company recorded a net loss of $13.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, and expects to incur losses in subsequent periods for at least the next several years. The Company is highly dependent on its ability to find additional sources of funding through either equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing agreements or a combination of any such transactions. Management believes that the Company’s existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2023 will be sufficient to fund its current operating plans through at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Adequate additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate research and development programs, or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that the Company might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company changed its stock-based compensation policy for recognizing expense for graded vesting awards with only service conditions from the accelerated attribution method to the straight-line attribution method. The Company believes the straight-line attribution method for stock-based compensation expense for awards solely subject to time-based vesting conditions is the preferable accounting policy in accordance with ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, because it more accurately reflects how the award is earned over the service period and is the predominant method used in its industry. The Company applied the change retrospectively adjusting all periods presented resulting in a decrease to net loss of $16.3 million and a decrease to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.06 for the first quarter of 2022.

Revenue from the U.S. Government, which includes foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. Government, includes revenue from contracts for which the Company is the prime contractor as well as those for which the Company is a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. Government. The KGS and US segments have substantial revenue from the U.S. Government. Sales to the U.S. Government amounted to approximately $160.3 million and $139.6 million, or 69% and 71% of total Kratos revenue, for the three months ended March 26, 2023 and March 27, 2022, respectively.

The cumulative impact of the retrospective application of the LDTI adoption increased net income attributable to shareholders by $319.5 million and $65.9 million for each of the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively ($385.4 million cumulatively), and increased other comprehensive income by $589.6 million and $10.3 million for each of the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively ($599.9 million cumulatively). These increases were primarily as a result of an increase in discount rates and Global Atlantic’s instrument-specific credit risk during each of the respective periods.

These
unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among
other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying
unaudited financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $30,237 and $24,759 for the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The working capital deficit was $380,935 as of February 28, 2023. The net cash generated from operating activities was
$0 for both the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of this report.

Revenues from operating leases for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $8.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As noted above, the Company is in
the growth and acquisition stage and, accordingly, has not yet reached profitability from its operations. Since inception, the
Company has been engaged in financing activities and executing its business plan of operations and incurring costs and expenses
related to product development, branding, inventory buildup and product launch. As a result, the Company has continued to incur net
losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 of ($227,055)
and ($2,628,237),
respectively. The Company’s accumulated deficit was ($34,339,865)
as of March 31, 2023, and ($34,112,810)
as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s working capital was $6,477,127
as of March 31, 2023, compared to $6,678,562
as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in working capital from December 31, 2022, to March 31, 2023, is due to the Company incurring a net loss during the three
months ending March 31, 2023. Until recently the Company’s activities since inception have been sustained through equity/debt
financing and the continued usage of deferral of payments on accounts payable and other expenses.

The company’s potentially dilutive securities consist of shares issuable on vesting of restricted stock grants computed using the treasury method and amounted to 2,000 and 6,000 for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, respectively. For the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the average market price of the company's common stock exceeded the exercise price of the Convertible Notes (as defined below) resulting in 781,000 and 1,688,000 diluted common stock equivalents to be included in the diluted net earnings per share, respectively. There have been no material conversions to date. See Note 12, Financing Arrangements for further details on the Convertible Notes. There were no anti-dilutive restricted stock grants excluded from common stock equivalents in any period presented.

The Company has recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of approximately $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Management has projected that based on our hashing rate at March 31, 2023, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations beyond the next 12 months if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. We require additional capital and if we are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $84 million in on pre-tax income of $380 million compared to $99 million on pre-tax income of $378 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods is calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. In calculating “ordinary” income, non‑taxable income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was deducted from pre-tax income.

1. The Company reviews available positive and negative evidence to assess the need for a valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets. On the basis of this assessment, a full valuation allowance was recorded against the Company's net deferred tax assets in 2020 and maintained through December 31, 2022. The Company subsequently recorded net income attributable to Unit Corporation of $148.4 million and $60.6 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. After considering these positive results, the resulting significant three-year cumulative income position, and other available positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred tax assets would be realized. Accordingly, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance contributing to a $94.7 million net change in the valuation allowance during the three months ended March 31, 2023 with a corresponding income tax benefit recorded in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

---

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company reported a nominal tax expense on a pretax loss of $38.1 million. The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to losses incurred in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is recognized.

Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. The Company has loans and certain preferred equity investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and are generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized PIK dividends from investments of $25 and PIK interest from investments of $93.  

---

The Company has evaluated whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, which raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the original issuance date of the consolidated financial statements. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred net losses of $10.5 million and $142.0 million, respectively. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses in the next few years.

We generally lease our office properties to lessees in exchange for fixed monthly payments that cover rent, property taxes, insurance and certain cost recoveries, primarily common area maintenance. Office properties owned by us that are under lease are primarily located in Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond and Tampa and are leased to a wide variety of lessees across many industries. Our leases are operating leases and mostly range from three to 10 years. We recognized rental and other revenues related to operating lease payments of $209.4 million and $203.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Included in these amounts are variable lease payments of $19.4 million and $17.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The Company had no revenues for the three
months ended April 30, 2023. The Company currently has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient
to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment
capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through
the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any
of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

Segment profit in the 2023 Quarter included a $59 million (or $0.34 per share) charge for rework associated with subcontractor design errors, related schedule impacts and system integration testing timelines on the LAX Automated People Mover project.

The Company has certain investments in its portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision, which represents contractual interest or dividends that are added to the principal balance and recorded as income. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, PIK interest included in interest income totaled $9,454 and $194, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, PIK interest included in interest income totaled $9,616 and $579, respectively. The Company stops accruing PIK interest when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. To maintain RIC tax

We recognize revenue and estimate deferred revenue based on the cost of development service incurred over the total estimated cost of development services to be provided for the development period. For revenue recognition purposes, the development period is estimated to be completed in 2026. It is possible that this period will change and is assessed at each reporting date. ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) requires that an entity include a constraint on the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is considered “constrained” if there is a potential for significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. As part of the constraint evaluation, we considered numerous factors, including a potential shift in certain responsibilities between the two parties which would result in changes to the net cost sharing payments, for which outcomes are difficult to predict as of the date of this Report. As a result, no collaboration revenue is recognized from the biosimilar program for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We will continue to evaluate the variable transaction price and related revenue recognition in each reporting period and as the above uncertainties are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, we recognized $3.6 million of revenue related to development services.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded a tax expense of $30,372 on pre-tax income of $61,542, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The higher tax rate was primarily due to the impact of certain non-deductible expenses, state tax expense, and tax deficiencies on share-based compensation.

---

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a tax expense of $82,846 on pre-tax income of $284,987, resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The higher tax rate was due to the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and state tax expense.

continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing from its stockholders or other sources, as
may be required, to meet its financial obligations as they become due.

We
have incurred losses since inception, devoting substantially all of our efforts toward research and development, and have an
accumulated deficit of $68.3
million at March 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we generated a net loss of $4.0
million and we expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable
future. Based on our current plans, we believe our current cash balances are adequate for at least the next twelve months. Our
ability to execute our longer-term operating plans, including future clinical trials for our portfolio of drugs depend on
our ability to obtain additional funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities, a strategic transaction or other funding
transactions. We plan to continue to actively pursue financing alternatives, but there can be no assurance that we will obtain the
necessary funding in the future when necessary.

The
Company focuses on five strategic verticals that represent sub-segments of the staffing industry. These five strategic pillars,
accounting & finance, information technology, engineering, administration, and commercial are the basis for the Company’s
sales and revenue generation and its growth acquisition targets. The Headway Acquisition in May 2022 added 33%
in revenue, or approximately $60,700
to $184,100
of revenue from the business not including Headway (each as defined herein). The Headway Acquisition included approximately $60,000
in Employer of Record service contracts. Employer of Record (“EOR”) projects are typically large volume, long-term
providing HR outsourcing of payroll and benefits for a contingent workforce. EOR projects while priced with lower gross margin
percentages than traditional temporary staffing assignments, yield a comparable contribution as a result of lower costs to deliver
these services. Typical
contribution for EOR projects is 80-85% of the gross profit earned, compared to 40-50% for traditional staffing which negates the
impact of lower gross margins. This EOR service offering could be added to the Company’s other Brands (defined below),
providing for a growth element within the existing client base, both in the U.S. and U.K. markets. The Headway Acquisition also
brought an active workforce in all 50 states in the U.S., as well as Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. The Company anticipates that
this will provide for potential expansion of accounts for all brands in the group’s portfolio
(“Brands”).

To the extent the Company maintains a controlling financial interest in an alliance, the alliance’s financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company and the related processing fees are treated as an intercompany transaction and eliminated in consolidation. To the extent the Company has significant influence in, but not control of, an alliance, the Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in the alliance. As a result, the processing and other service fees charged to merchant alliances accounted for under the equity method are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income primarily as processing and services revenue. Such fees totaled $44 million and $47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $135 million and $140 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No directors or officers of the Company have ownership interests in any of the alliances. The formation of each of these alliances generally involves the Company and the financial institution contributing contracts with merchants to the alliance and a cash payment from one owner to the other to achieve the desired ownership percentage for each. The Company and the financial institution enter into a long-term processing service agreement, which governs the Company’s provision of transaction processing services to the alliance. The Company had approximately $42 million and $43 million of amounts due from unconsolidated merchant alliances included within trade accounts receivable, net in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $33 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $114 million. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $18 million relative to earnings before income taxes of $115 million.

Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of the Company's pretax income resulting from its business mix, changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, special items, certain equity related compensation, and other discrete tax items that may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.

The allocation of the total consideration to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed is preliminary until the Company obtains final information regarding their fair values.  The primary items that generated the goodwill recognized were the premiums paid by the Company for the future earnings potential of Exxelia and the value of its assembled workforce that do not qualify for separate recognition, however, benefit both the Company and the noncontrolling interest holders.  The fair value of the noncontrolling interests were determined based on the consideration paid by the Company for its controlling ownership interest adjusted for a lack of control that a market participant would consider when estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling interest.  The amortization period of the customer relationships, intellectual property and trade name acquired is 18 years, 16 years and indefinite, respectively.

These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The following table presents certain financial information related to Barnwell’s reporting segments. All revenues reported are from external customers with no intersegment sales or transfers.

The Company reported an income tax provision of $100.5 million on pretax loss of $104.5 million and an income tax provision of $108.5 million on pretax loss of $110.2 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to an income tax provision of $2.1 million on pretax loss of $20.2 million and an income tax provision of $2.7 million on pretax loss of $430.8 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 reflects an increase in tax expense primarily attributable to the recognition of a reserve for uncertain tax positions, overall growth in foreign jurisdictions associated with an increase in profit and non-deductible stock-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate substantially differed from the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to the recognition of a reserve for uncertain tax positions, different tax rates, non-deductible stock-based compensation in foreign jurisdictions, in addition to full valuation allowances in the U.S. and Australia.

---

Contract
liabilities consist of amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized. The increase in contract liabilities is primarily
due to payments received for the following; $1.0 million related to future grant revenue and $0.4 million for future sales revenue during
the nine months ended January 31, 2023 for which revenue has not been recognized.

The Company is in the early stages of exploration and, as is common with any exploration company, it raises financing for its acquisition activities. The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will continue operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a loss of $2,146,016 for the six-month period ended January 31, 2023 and has accumulated a deficit of $25,154,620. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company's ability to maintain continued support from its shareholders and creditors and to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that such financing will be on terms advantageous to the Company. These events and conditions cast significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going
concern. The Company has incurred net losses of approximately $1.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and approximately
$6.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2022. The Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $38,000 as of January 31,
2023. In addition, the revenues of the Company do not provide adequate working capital for the Company to sustain its current and planned
business operations.

The
Company has incurred continuing losses since 2016, including a loss of $498,947 and $465,117 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022,
and the nine-month ended November 30, 2022, respectively. During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred cash losses

Since
inception, the Company’s activities have consisted primarily of performing research and development to advance its product candidates.
The Company is still in the development phase and has not been marketing any developed products to date. Since inception, the Company
has incurred losses, including a net loss of approximately $6.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31,
2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $51.9 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses.
The Company expects that its cash will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least
12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product
revenue from sales of any current or future product candidates, the Company expects to seek additional funding in order to reach its
development and commercialization objectives through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through collaboration,
license and development agreements. The Company may not be able to obtain funding or enter into collaboration, license or development
agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any funding may be dilutive to or adversely affect the rights of the Company’s
stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding on satisfactory terms, or at all, the Company could be forced to delay, scale
back or eliminate the development of its current or future product candidates or other business.

The decrease was driven by lower disk drive volumes causing a decline in profitability and the expected initial negative earnings impact from the recent acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $46.1 million and its accumulated deficit was $878.5 million. The Company estimates that its current cash and cash equivalents balance is sufficient to support operations beyond the twelve month period following the date that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. These estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects.

We
recorded $21,241,015 and $17,285,302 in revenue, respectively, for the nine months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021.

Beginning in fiscal year 2023, to align the presentation of revenue with the manner in which management reviews such information, the presentation of "products" and "services and other" revenue and the presentation of "costs and expenses" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations were reclassified to move revenue and costs and expenses primarily related to bundled licenses and KeysightCare services from products to services and other. This resulted in reclassification of $20 million from "products" revenue to "services and other" revenue and $3 million from "cost of products" to "cost of services and other" for the three months ended January 31, 2022 to conform to the current presentation. This change had no impact on reported total revenue, income from operations and net income in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

---

Our operating lease income was $18 million and $39 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, and $29 million and $61 million for the corresponding periods of fiscal 2022, respectively, and was included in product revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

---

We recorded a $70 million tax benefit on a pretax income of $30 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. We recorded a $60 million tax benefit on a pretax income of $268 million for the six months ended January 31, 2022. Excluding discrete tax items primarily related to share-based compensation tax benefits including those mentioned above, our effective tax rate for both periods was approximately 25%. The difference from the federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the tax benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit.

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $74,155,929 as of December 31, 2022
and total stockholders’ deficit of $6,881,906. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $616,943
as compared to a net loss of $10,591,638 during the same period ended December 31, 2021. These factors as well as the uncertain conditions
that the Company faces in its day-to-day operations with respect to cash flows create an uncertainty as to the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern. Management has taken action to strengthen the Company’s working capital position and generate
sufficient cash to meet its operating needs through June 30, 2023 and beyond.

During
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $5 thousand on loss from continuing
operations before income tax of $3.2 million, and $4 thousand on a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $2.1 million,
respectively. During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $10 thousand on
loss from continuing operations before income tax of $8.4 million, and $4 thousand on a loss from continuing operations before income
tax of $130.3 million, respectively. The change in income tax expense in relation to the loss before income tax during the three and
six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three and six months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily due to differences in the
amount of taxable (loss) income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the associated valuation allowances. As of January 31, 2023 and
2022, the Company recorded valuation allowances for the total deferred tax asset balances.
