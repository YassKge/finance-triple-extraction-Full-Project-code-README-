Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $0.2 million relative to loss before income taxes of $45.8 million.  The income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $0.5 million relative to loss before income taxes of $57.5 million. The expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is the result of income generated by our UK operations for which tax expense has been recognized based on a full year estimated income tax liability, and the inability to recognize benefit on losses in the U.S. and Switzerland. Whereas the expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was the result of income generated in the U.S. and UK. The decrease in U.S. income in the first quarter of 2024 is due to a change in the Company operating and transfer pricing model which was implemented in October 2023. We remain a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets, and each reporting period, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and adjust our estimates as more information becomes available.

Since
inception, the Company’s activities have consisted primarily of performing research and development to advance its product candidates.
The Company is still in the development phase and has not been marketing any developed products to date. Since inception, the Company
has incurred losses, including a net loss of approximately $5.2 million for the six-month period ended December 31, 2023. As of December
31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $62.4 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses. The
Company expects that its cash, along with access to the Facility Amount under the LSA (as defined below in Note 10), will be sufficient
to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial
statements. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenue from sales of any current or future product
candidates, the Company expects to seek additional funding in order to reach its development and commercialization objectives through
various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through collaboration, license and development agreements. The Company
may not be able to obtain funding or enter into collaboration, license or development agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. The
terms of any funding may be dilutive to or adversely affect the rights of the Company’s stockholders. If the Company is unable
to obtain funding on satisfactory terms, or at all, the Company could be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of
its current or future product candidates or other business.

The Company is still in the development phase and has not been marketing any developed products to date. Since inception, the Company
has incurred losses, including a net loss of approximately $6.9 million for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2024. As of March 31,
2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $64.1 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses. The Company
expects that its cash, along with access to the Facility Amount under the LSA (as defined below in Note 10), will be sufficient to fund
its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements.
Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenue from sales of any current or future product candidates,
the Company expects to seek additional funding in order to reach its development and commercialization objectives through various potential
sources, such as equity and debt financings or through collaboration, license and development agreements. The Company may not be able
to obtain funding or enter into collaboration, license or development agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any funding
may be dilutive to or adversely affect the rights of the Company’s stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding on
satisfactory terms, or at all, the Company could be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of its current or future
product candidates or other business.

The Company recognizes contractual revenues from leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective lease. Our leases regularly include allowances for tenant improvements. If we determine the improvements are our assets, we capitalize the cost of the improvements and recognize depreciation expense associated with such improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease. If the improvements are tenant assets, we defer the cost of improvements funded by us as a lease incentive asset and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the term of the lease. Our determination of whether improvements are our assets or tenant assets also affects when we commence revenue recognition in connection with a lease. The Company records deferred revenue for the portion of company owned tenant improvements funded by or reimbursed by tenants and amortizes this amount on a straight-line basis into rental income over the term of the related lease. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had unamortized deferred income related to tenant-funded tenant improvements of $141.0 million and $100.1 million, respectively, included in deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements (“CFS”) were prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the three months
ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of approximately $4.14 million and $1.30 million, respectively.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of approximately $6.00 million and $3.92 million,
respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $34.06 million as of March 31, 2024, and negative cash flow
from operating activities of approximately $5.95 million and $2.33 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The historical operating results including recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about the Company’s

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred substantial operating losses in
the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 primarily due to reduced gross margins caused by a combination of
competitors’ introduction of newer products with more advanced features together with significant price cutting of their
products and the recent acquisitions with much smaller margins than the video solutions segment, historically. The Company incurred
operating losses of approximately $22.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $29.7
million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and it had an accumulated deficit of $117.7
million as of December 31, 2023. These matters raise substantial doubt about Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. In recent years the Company has accessed the public and private capital markets to raise funding through the issuance of
debt and equity. In that regard, the Company raised approximately $66.6 million
in the year ended December 31, 2021 through two underwritten public offerings. These equity raises were utilized to fund its
operations and acquisitions. Management expects to continue this pattern until it achieves positive cash flows from operations,
although it can offer no assurance in this regard.

The pro forma earnings are adjusted to reflect the comparable impact of additional depreciation and amortization expense, net of tax, resulting from the fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets; nonrecurring acquisition-related costs, net of tax, of $5,855; and inventory step-up charges, net of tax, of $15,082. These unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon purchase price allocations. The actual revenues and earnings for RegO and Acme Cryogenics from the date of acquisition on December 28, 2021 and December 16, 2021, respectively, to December 31, 2021 were not material.

The
Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 6% per annum, payable annually on the last day of December of each year. Dividends
shall accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative. Dividends are payable at the Company’s option either

The increase during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in non-interest income as a result of a $23.4 million loss on the disposition of available-for-sale investment securities during the 2023 period. This increase was partially offset by lower net interest income as a result of higher interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds.

To the extent the Company maintains a controlling financial interest in an alliance, the alliance’s financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company and the related processing fees are treated as an intercompany transaction and eliminated in consolidation. To the extent the Company has significant influence in, but not control of, an alliance, the Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in the alliance. As a result, the processing and other service fees charged to merchant alliances accounted for under the equity method are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income primarily as processing and services revenue. Such fees totaled $40 million and $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No directors or officers of the Company have ownership interests in any of the alliances. The formation of each of these alliances generally involves the Company and the financial institution contributing contracts with merchants to the alliance and a cash payment from one owner to the other to achieve the desired ownership percentage for each. The Company and the financial institution enter into a long-term processing service agreement, which governs the Company’s provision of transaction processing services to the alliance. The Company had approximately $38 million of amounts due from unconsolidated merchant alliances included within trade accounts receivable, net in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company identified an error in the calculation of the Company’s tax provision which understated income tax expense for previously reported financial statements. The error was related to an incorrect application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits tax deductions relating to executive compensation of certain executives of publicly held companies. The Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment during the third quarter of 2022 to correct the previously understated income tax expense. The adjustment resulted in a decrease to after-tax income of $(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact associated with this correction was not considered material to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2022, year ended December 31, 2022, or the financial statements of any previously filed interim or annual periods.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was higher than in the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the Company’s valuation allowance, which was released during the year ended December 31, 2023. The effective tax rates for both the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 differ from the 21% federal statutory rate and applicable state statutory rates primarily due to the disallowance of executive compensation expenses not deductible for tax and to the pre-tax portion of income and losses that are passed through to the other partners of the Operating Company and the San Francisco Venture.

Premium income for traditional long-duration life and health insurance products is recognized evenly over the contract period and when due from the policyholder. Premiums for short-duration health contracts are recognized as revenue over the contract period in proportion to the insurance protection provided. Premiums for universal life-type and annuity contracts are added to the policy account value, and revenues for such products are recognized as charges to the policy account value for mortality, administration, and surrenders (retrospective deposit method). Life premium includes policy charges of $12.9 million, $13.5 million, and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

For limited-payment life insurance products, the profits are recognized over the contract period.

The Company recognized net income attributable to stockholders of $51.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with $26.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.

This higher rate was due to the continued capitalization of research and development expenditures for U.S. tax purposes combined with the Company's inability to record deferred tax assets on its balance sheet given its U.S. valuation allowance position. See Note 5 of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Company's income tax provision.

The license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, event-based milestone payments, sales-based royalty payments, or some combination of these. The event-based milestone payments represent variable consideration and we use the most likely amount method to estimate this variable consideration. Given the high degree of uncertainly around the achievement of these milestones, we do not recognize revenue from these milestone payments until the uncertainty associated with these payments is resolved. We currently estimate variable consideration related to milestone payments to be zero and, as such, no revenue has been recognized for milestone payments. We recognize revenue from sales-based royalty payments when or as sales occur. On a quarterly basis, we re-evaluate our estimate of milestone variable consideration to determine whether any amount should be included in the transaction price and recorded in revenue prospectively.

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Since inception,
the Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, primarily as a result of its ongoing investment in
product development. For the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred losses from operations of $25,831 and $21,065,
respectively, and as of March 31, 2024 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $85,241. The Company has historically financed its operations
through the issuance and sale of equity securities and the issuance of debt. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses
and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future and will need to raise additional debt or equity financing to fund
its operations and satisfy its obligations. While the Company recently entered into a committed equity facility to raise additional capital,
the amount and timing of the proceeds, if any, the Company may receive from the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock thereunder will
depend on a number of factors, including the numbers of shares the Company may elect to sell, the timing of such sales, the future market
price of the Company’s Class A Common stock and the payment of the cash commitment fee (see Note 16—Equity). Management
believes that there is substantial doubt concerning the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as the Company currently
does not have adequate liquidity to meet its operating needs and satisfy its obligations beyond the next approximately ninety days.

During the first quarter of 2023, management determined that its prior treatment of property taxes in those instances where the Company was responsible for paying property taxes and subsequently seeking tenant reimbursement should be treated differently than those instances where property taxes were paid directly by tenants to taxing authorities.

Our lessor arrangements include storage and railcar contracts, of which certain agreements contain renewal options for periods of between one year and five years. We determine if an agreement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. If an arrangement is determined to contain a lease, we classify the lease as operating, sales-type or direct financing. Lessor accounting under ASC 842 is substantially unchanged and all of our leases will continue to be classified as operating leases. We also, from time to time, sublease certain of our storage capacity and railcars to third-parties. Fixed rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. During the years ended March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, fixed rental revenue was $17.8 million, $13.9 million and $14.4 million, which includes $6.2 million, $3.8 million and $1.4 million of sublease revenue, respectively.

At the request of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Space Systems submitted an engineering change proposal (ECP) during the fourth quarter of 2023 for scope increases and other aspects of the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) contract largely stemming from evolving Lunar Gateway architecture and mission requirements. The ECP addresses both work performed and work expected to be performed by the company resulting from scope changes previously approved by NASA, as well as changes NASA has requested the company to propose but has not yet directed the company to perform. The company has begun negotiating with NASA on these various changes and other aspects of the HALO contract. The company’s 2023 results include $100 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the HALO contract and reflect our current best estimate of the outcome of the ECP negotiations assuming the terms of the current contract; however, if the outcome is less favorable than what we have assumed, it could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

EAC adjustments on a single performance obligation can have a significant effect on the company’s financial statements. When such adjustments occur, we generally disclose the nature, underlying conditions and financial impact of the adjustments. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a $143 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on the first LRIP lot of the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems as described above. During 2023, we recorded $100 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the HALO program at Space Systems largely due to cost growth stemming from evolving Lunar Gateway architecture and mission requirements combined with macroeconomic challenges. During 2022, we recorded $133 million of favorable EAC adjustments on the EMD phase of the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems. During 2021, we recorded $135 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the F-35 program at Aeronautics Systems. No other such adjustments were significant to the financial statements during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

Basic income/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) less cumulative dividends attributable to preferred stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding. Diluted income/(loss) per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic income/(loss) per share while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period when there is net income. The performance stock units and non-vested restricted stock units are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income/(loss) per share. However, these instruments are included in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted income per share under the treasury stock method for periods when there is net income. The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into cash or combination of cash and Company’s common stock. The Company is including the potential share settlements, if any, in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted income per share under the if converted method for periods when there is net income. The potential shares settlements are calculated as the excess of the Company's conversion obligation over the aggregate principal amount (which will be settled in cash), divided by the average share price for the period. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, there was no dilutive effect for the Convertible Senior Notes as the Company recorded a net loss.

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”), assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended December
31, 2023, the Company had a net loss available for common stockholders of approximately $10,821,000. As of December 31, 2023, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of approximately $178,426,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $10,406,000. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, within one year from the issuance date of this filing.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise the required additional capital or debt
financing to meet short and long-term operating requirements. During the nine months ended December 31, 2023, the Company received net
cash proceeds of approximately $2,323,000 from the sale of common shares (See Note 8), $150,000 from the sale of Series E Preferred stock,
$97,000 from the sale of Series G Preferred stock and the Company received $140,000 proceeds from the issuance of promissory notes, related
parties. Subsequent to period end, the Company received approximately $248,000 for the sale of common shares and $97,000 from the sale
of Series G Preferred stock (See Note 12).

Under the Gilead Agreement, Gilead has the option to license drug candidates directed to up to five targets resulting from the collaboration and is responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of drug candidates resulting from the collaboration. The Company retains the option to co-develop and co-promote, under a profit share structure, up to two drug candidates in the United States, provided that the Company may only exercise such option once per licensed product and Gilead retains the right to veto the Company’s option selection for any one drug candidate of its choice. The collaboration excludes the Company’s current internal protein degradation programs for which the Company retains all rights, and also excludes the Company’s future internal programs, provided that the Company has distinguished future programs as excluded from the scope of the collaboration. In March 2023, Gilead exercised the option, which did not represent a material right at contract inception, since it was not offered for free or at a discount, to exclusively license one target (Gilead License Option Exercise), the first development candidate resulting from the Gilead Agreement. Pursuant to the Gilead Agreement, the Company received a license option exercise payment of $20.0 million in April 2023 for the Gilead License Option Exercise.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested Restricted Stock. Unvested Restricted Stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at March 31, 2023, was considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapsed and was not included in the basic net loss per share calculation for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Unvested Restricted Stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents.

The Company has incurred recurring net losses since inception and has funded its operations to date through the sale of common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, the issuance of convertible notes and debt, and grant proceeds. The Company incurred net losses of approximately $63.1 million and $86.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $286.2 million and cash and cash equivalents totaling $39.5 million. This amount will not meet the Company's capital requirements over the next 12 months after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents will enable it to fund its operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates and the risks associated with the research, development, and commercialization of biotechnology products, the Company may have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company's operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to the Company.

Included in the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2023 is a total of 22,365,731 common shares issuable upon the exercise of Public Offering Pre-funded Warrants and Private Placement Pre-funded Warrants (described in Note 9 below), which are exercisable at any time for nominal consideration, and as such, the shares are considered outstanding for the purpose of calculating basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders.

---

The
computation of basic (loss) earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. The computation of diluted (loss) earnings per common share is based on the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year plus common stock equivalents, which would arise from the exercise of options and warrants outstanding using the treasury
stock method and the average market price per share during the year. The number of common shares potentially issuable upon the exercise
of certain awards that were excluded from the diluted loss per common share calculation in 2023 and 2022 was 31,727 and 93,626 related
to options, and 52,607 and 170,859 related to restricted stock units, for a total of 84,334 and 264,485, respectively, because they are
anti-dilutive, as a result of the net losses incurred in each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The Company recorded a net loss of $52.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and expects to incur losses in subsequent periods for at least the next several years. The Company is highly dependent on its ability to find additional sources of funding through either equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing agreements or a combination of any such transactions. Management believes that the Company’s existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 will be sufficient to fund its current operating plans through at least 12 months from the date of filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adequate additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate research and development programs, or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that the Company might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required. For the year ended December 31, 2023, CM Tech has negative
cash flow from operations in prior year but has turned positive in 2023. The Company is working towards consistently generating positive

— Current trends in hydraulic fracturing equipment operating conditions such as larger pads, changes to job design and increased pumping hours per day have resulted in shorter useful lives for certain critical components that are included in our property and equipment assets. These recent trends necessitated a review of useful lives of our critical components like fluid ends, power ends, hydraulic fracturing units and other components in the first quarter of 2023. We determined that the estimated useful life of fluid ends is now less than one year, resulting in our determination that costs associated with the replacement of these components will no longer be capitalized, but instead recorded in inventories and amortized to cost of services over their estimated useful life. We have also shortened the estimated useful lives of power ends to two years from five years and hydraulic fracturing units to ten years from fifteen years. This change in accounting estimates was made effective January 1, 2023 and accounted for prospectively. The net effect of this change for the year ended December 31, 2023, was a $19.1 million decrease in net income, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, respectively.

At
September 30, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficit and a stockholders’ deficit of $41.5
million and $27.6
million, respectively. While the Company had net income of $1.5
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, it incurred a net loss of $0.5 million and $3.3
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. As of the date of this report, its cash
is deficient and payments for its operations in the ordinary course are not being made. Losses in prior years and other related

payable and debentures, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from
the filing date of this report.

The
Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. For the year ended December 31,
2023, the Company reported a net loss of $10.2 million and an accumulated deficit of $41.4 million and does not expect to generate positive
cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to incur significant and increasing losses until regulatory
approval is granted for its first product candidate, RenovoGem™. Regulatory approval is not guaranteed and may never be obtained.
The Company believes it will be able to raise additional capital through debt financings, private or public equity financings, license
agreements, collaborative agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources of financing. There can be no assurance
that such financing will be available or will be at terms acceptable to the Company. The inability to raise capital as and when needed
would have a negative impact on the Company’s liquidity financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The
Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so.

We recognize revenue and estimate deferred revenue based on the cost of development service incurred over the total estimated cost of development services to be provided for the development period. For revenue recognition purposes, the development period has an estimated accounting program end date of 2026. It is possible that this period will change and is assessed at each reporting date. ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) requires that an entity include a constraint on the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is considered “constrained” if there is a potential for significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. As part of the constraint evaluation, we considered numerous factors, including a shift in certain responsibilities between the two parties which would result in changes to the net cost sharing payments and the total project budget, for which outcomes are difficult to predict as of the date of this Report. We will continue to evaluate the variable transaction price and related revenue recognition in each reporting period and as the above uncertainties are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recognized revenue related to development services under the Viatris Agreement of $9.0 million, $7.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively.

In general, it is Snap-on’s practice and intention to reinvest certain earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of 2023 year end, the company has not made a provision for incremental U.S. income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $471.9 million of such undistributed earnings that is deemed indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. As a result of the Tax Act, which subjected the majority of the company’s undistributed foreign earnings to taxation for the 2017 tax year, the company can now repatriate non-U.S. cash in a tax efficient manner. Accordingly, the company does not have an indefinitely reinvested assertion on the majority of undistributed earnings for its non-U.S. subsidiaries and has recorded a deferred tax liability of $3.9 million for the incremental tax costs associated with the future potential repatriation of such earnings.

The Company has recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of approximately $4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Management has projected that based on our hashing rate at March 31, 2024, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations and there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. We require additional capital and if we are unsuccessful in raising that capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We incurred a net loss from operations of $1,049,885 during the three months ended March 31, 2024,  compared to a net loss from operations of $1,449,746 in the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Our business is capital intensive and, because our products are built to order with customized configurations, the lead time to build and deliver a unit can be significant. We may be required to purchase key components long before we can deliver a unit and receive payment. Changes in customer orders or lack of demand may also impact our profitability. There can be no assurance we will be able to increase our sales and achieve and sustain profitability in the future.  Our cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund our business and, currently, we are reliant upon financing provided by a related party to help fund our operations. (

In
                        fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $816,000 compared to $1,572,000 in fiscal year 2022 and a net loss of $312,000
                        and $108,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  As of March 31, 2024, the Company had
                        an accumulated deficit in stockholders’ equity of $2,702,000, cash and cash equivalents of $1,750,000 and a working capital deficit of $396,000. 






                        In addition, the Company currently does not have access to capital through a line of credit nor other readily available sources of capital.  Together, these factors raised substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to
                        continue as a going concern at March 31, 2024.  However, management has considered its plans to continue the Company as a going concern, concentrating on the establishment and operation of managed health care plans.  As noted above,
                        during the first quarter of 2024, the Company raised gross proceeds of $2.1 million in support of this business
                        opportunity through the sale of its Common Stock in a private placement and believes it has access to additional capital through the remainder of 2024.  Additionally, the Company believes that these activities and resulting expenses
                        can be managed to the level of cash resources on hand and expected to be raised. Management believes its plan alleviates the substantial doubt, that it will be successful in its planned business initiatives and will be able to
                        continue as a going concern through at least the next twelve months.  However, there can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to the Company at that time or, if available, can be obtained on terms favorable to
                        the Company.

The
Company has incurred losses of $83,938 for the year ended December 31, 2023, has working capital deficit and has an accumulated deficit
of $111,742 as of December 31, 2023. Management believes these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the date these financial statements are issued. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management’s plan to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate, raise additional
capital from issuance of stock or receive continued financial support and additional borrowings from the existing promissory note from
stockholder. Management intends to finance operations over the next twelve months through additional borrowings from the existing Note.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

The Company's future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to generate enough revenue or raise capital to support its operations.

As a result of this review, in 2022, we updated our estimate of the unearned premium reserve for certain of our product lines to utilize a gross unearned premium reserve rather than a net unearned premium reserve.  The effect of this change in estimate was to decrease 2022 premium income by $13.4 million and decrease commissions by $1.0 million.  This resulted in a decrease to net income of $9.8 million and a decrease to both basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.05.

The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using account principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”)
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has a cumulative net loss from inception to December 31, 2023 of approximately $24 million. The accompanying financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2023 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company’s cash
resources may be insufficient to meet its anticipated needs during the next twelve months. The Company may require additional funding
on acceptable terms to support it is planned future operations. Management’s plans include executing on its business plan and raising
external funds to the extent needed. These factors are indicators that there is substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a
going concern for one year from the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to undertake further exploration
and development activities and ultimately generating profitable operations from its oil and natural gas interests in the future. The
Company’s current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of its current assets to meet its current expenditure requirements
and the accuracy of management’s estimates of those requirements. Should those estimates be materially incorrect, the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern may be in doubt. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. During the year ended December
31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $8.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $286.6 million.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the
financials were issued.

In accordance with its policy, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that the actual lives of certain developed technology were shorter than the estimated useful lives used for amortization purposes in the Company's financial statements. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, the Company changed its estimates of the useful lives of certain developed technology to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The remaining useful life of certain developed technology that was 3.25 years at January 1, 2021 was reduced to 2 years, while the remaining useful life of certain developed technology that was 4.25 years was reduced to 3 years. The effect of this change was to increase 2021 amortization expense by approximately $1.0 million and decrease 2021 net income and basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.8 million and $0.06, respectively.

Our financial
statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) applicable
to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
We have no ongoing business or income and for the six-month ended December 31, 2023 we incurred a loss of $26,272 and had an accumulated
deficit of $17,791,240 as of December 31, 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet our
ongoing operating expenses and ultimately in merging with another entity with experienced management and profitable operations.
No assurances can be given that we will be successful in achieving these objectives.
