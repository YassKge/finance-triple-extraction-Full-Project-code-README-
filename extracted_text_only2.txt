In connection with the separation, the Company entered into a separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with bluebird bio, dated as of November 3, 2021, that, among other things, set forth bluebird bio’s agreements with 2seventy bio regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the separation, including the distribution. The effective time of the distribution was 12:01 a.m. on November 4, 2021. The Separation Agreement identifies assets transferred to, liabilities assumed by and contracts assigned to 2seventy bio as part of the separation, and it provides for when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments occur. Each of 2seventy bio and bluebird bio agreed to releases, with respect to pre-separation claims, and cross indemnities with respect to post-separation claims, that are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities allocated to 2seventy bio under the Separation Agreement with 2seventy bio and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities allocated to bluebird bio under the Separation Agreement. Following the completion of the separation and distribution, the Company and bluebird bio have operated separately, each as an independent public company and bluebird bio no longer owns any shares of the Company’s common stock. Therefore, starting in 2023, transactions under those agreements are no longer accounted for as related party transactions. The Company recorded other income of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an expense of $0.2 million for the two months since separation through December 31, 2021, related to the Separation Agreement.

The Company has implemented software and hardware initiatives to manage its global network more efficiently and, as a result, the expected average useful life of its servers increased from five years to six years, effective January 1, 2023. These changes decreased depreciation expense by $15.3 million and $48.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and increased net income by $12.8 million and $40.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, or $0.08 and $0.26 per share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2023 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from five years to six years in January 2024, which, based on servers that are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023, will have an anticipated impact to our 2024 operating income of $3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from four years to five years in January 2022.

In connection with our periodic review of estimated useful lives of the property, plant, and equipment subsequent to the end of fiscal 2023, we will increase the estimated useful lives of certain assets. The estimated useful lives of certain buildings and improvements will increase by 5 years. The estimated range of useful lives of demonstration and manufacturing equipment will increase to between 5 to 8 years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2024 and will be applied on a prospective basis to the assets on our balance sheet as of October 29, 2023, as well as to future asset purchases. Based on the carrying amount of the assets included in property, plant and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 29, 2023, we currently estimate this change will increase income from operations before income taxes in fiscal 2024 by approximately $128 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.

Stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the underlying common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they are out-of-the-money and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The Company incurred a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, therefore all outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock units are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share because the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded from the computation was approximately 0.8 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2023, 1.4 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 1.4 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2023, the Company has unremitted earnings of $3,854 outside of Ireland as measured on a U.S. GAAP basis.  Whereas the measure of earnings for purposes of taxation of a distribution may be different for tax purposes, these earnings, which are considered to be invested indefinitely, would become subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends or if the Company were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries, net of any prior income taxes paid. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability on such earnings, if any.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a $0.3 million tax expense related to its foreign operations.  The Company’s tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the tax expense computed by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax loss of $48.3 million, as no tax benefits were recorded for current year tax losses generated in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  At September 30, 2023, the Company had deferred tax assets primarily related to U.S. Federal and state tax loss carryforwards and a deferred tax liability related to the Company’s convertible notes.  The Company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as future realization of such assets is not more likely than not to occur.

funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company’s ability to fund its operations, develop or enhance
its sensors in the future or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. Such limitations could require the Company
to curtail, suspend or discontinue parts of its business plan.

Since our contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. In addition, changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. We recorded changes to project estimates that unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $115, $30, and $19 in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $963,000 and $1,497,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $2,851,000 and $4,485,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.

12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements. Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product
revenue from sales of any current or future product candidates, the Company expects to seek additional funding in order to reach its
development and commercialization objectives through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through collaboration,
license and development agreements. The Company may not be able to obtain funding or enter into collaboration, license or development
agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any funding may be dilutive to or adversely affect the rights of the Company’s
stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding on satisfactory terms, or at all, the Company could be forced to delay, scale
back or eliminate the development of its current or future product candidates or other business.

The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities, and manufacturing  products for use in food, beverages, feed, energy, and industrial applications, and ingredients and solutions for human and animal nutrition.

The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.

The Company recognized revenue from transportation service contracts of $761 million, $818 million, and $606 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period (including 11,416,856 and 11,592,699 common shares held in a grantor trust as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively). The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since the shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of basic and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. 

---

Treasury shares have been excluded from average outstanding shares from the date of acquisition. The weighted average number of basic shares outstanding includes the impact of 11,663,450 common shares held in a grantor trust. The common shares held in the grantor trust are for delivery upon settlement of vested but mandatorily deferred restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Shares held by the grantor trust do not affect diluted shares outstanding since shares deliverable under vested RSUs were already included in diluted shares outstanding. The difference in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is attributable entirely to the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation plans. Changes in shares of common stock outstanding, net of treasury shares, are presented below. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding do not include shares related to unissued restricted stock units (including shares held in the grantor trust).

The Company
incurred net losses of $778,192 and $596,548 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company incurred
net losses of $314,842 and $199,233 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company also had an
accumulated deficit of $8,946,787 as of September 30, 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to increase its income by strengthening its sales force, providing attractive sales
incentive program, and increasing marketing and promotion activities. Management also intends to raise additional funds by way of a private
or public offering, or by obtaining loans from banks or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate

As
of September 30, 2023, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $4,607,418 and incurred a net loss of $775,630 for nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through September 30, 2023 is dependent upon improving profitability
and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will
provide additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due.

Net income decreased $13.0 million to $72.7 million, or $0.70 per share, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net income of $85.7 million, or $0.80 per share, for the same period in 2022. The decrease during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily attributable to lower net interest income as a result of higher interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. Lower net interest income was partially offset by lower non-interest expenses and an increase in non-interest income related to the $24.2 million loss on investment securities during the 2022 period. 

---

Net income increased $79.6 million to $196.0 million, or $1.89 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net income of $116.4 million, or $1.13 per share for the same period in 2022. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income after the reduction of provision for credit losses of $28.0 million, which was largely related to the non-PCD provision expense in 2022 associated with the GWB acquisition, and lower non-interest expenses of $99.9 million, related to the acquisition related expenses of $115.0 million in 2022. These impacts were partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in income tax expense in 2023.

Pursuant to certain transition services agreements, the Company provides, at fair value, various administration, business process outsourcing, and technical and data center related services for defined periods to certain joint ventures accounted for under the equity method. Amounts transacted through these agreements, including with InvestCloud through June 2021 (see Note 8), totaled $5 million, $18 million and $37 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were primarily recognized as processing and services revenue in the consolidated statements of income.

To the extent the Company maintains a controlling financial interest in an alliance, the alliance’s financial statements are consolidated with those of the Company and the related processing fees are treated as an intercompany transaction and eliminated in consolidation. To the extent the Company has significant influence in, but not control of, an alliance, the Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in the alliance. As a result, the processing and other service fees charged to merchant alliances accounted for under the equity method are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income primarily as processing and services revenue. Such fees totaled $177 million, $187 million and $171 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No directors or officers of the Company have ownership interests in any of the alliances. The formation of each of these alliances generally involves the Company and the financial institution contributing contracts with merchants to the alliance and a cash payment from one owner to the other to achieve the desired ownership percentage for each. The Company and the financial institution enter into a long-term processing service agreement, which governs the Company’s provision of transaction processing services to the alliance. The Company had approximately $38 million and $43 million of amounts due from unconsolidated merchant alliances included within trade accounts receivable, net in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

This distribution was for the remaining balance on the Company’s federal AAA for previously taxed, but undistributed, earnings.

The Company currently funds its operations with cash on hand, availability under the Asset Based Loan (“ABL”) (see Note 9, “Debt and Convertible Notes Payable”) and other current assets.  While the Company generated $22.6 million of net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company has a recent history of losses and negative cash flows from operations and expects to utilize a significant amount of cash within one year after the date of filing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  The availability of capital is dependent on the Company’s operating cash flow currently expected to be principally derived from the ProFrac Agreement (see Note 9, “Debt and Convertible Notes Payable” and Note 16, “Related Party Transactions”).  It is not certain that the Company’s cash, availability under the ABL and other current assets, along with the Company’s forecasted cash flows from operations, will provide the Company with sufficient financial resources to fund operations and meet the Company’s capital requirements and anticipated obligations as they become due in the next twelve months.  The Company may require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next twelve months to sufficiently alleviate or mitigate the conditions and events noted above, which results in substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are filed.

The United States and Canada segment EBT of $1,114 million for full year 2023 was $980 million lower than 2022, explained primarily by lower financing margin driven by higher borrowing costs, non-recurrence of supplemental depreciation and credit loss reserve releases, lower lease residual performance, and higher credit losses.

---

The Europe segment EBT of $306 million for full year 2023 was $8 million lower than 2022, explained primarily by non-recurrence of residual gains, higher operating costs primarily relating to restructuring, and lower credit loss reserve releases, partially offset by favorable changes in wholesale volumes and financing margin.

---

The All Other segment EBT of $75 million for full year 2023 was $213 million higher than 2022, explained primarily by the non-recurrence of South America restructuring losses.

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company identified an error in the calculation of the Company’s tax provision which understated income tax expense for previously reported financial statements. The error was related to an incorrect application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits tax deductions relating to executive compensation of certain executives of publicly held companies. The Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment during the third quarter of 2022 to correct the previously understated income tax expense. The adjustment resulted in a decrease to after-tax income of $(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact associated with this correction was not considered material to the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2022, year ended December 31, 2022, or the financial statements of any previously filed interim or annual periods.

We have consolidated the results of operations for SADA since its acquisition on December 1, 2023. Consolidated net sales and net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 include $33,451,000 and $14,502,000, respectively, from SADA. Due to seasonality in SADA's business, with the majority of net sales and net earnings historically being generated in the second half of the year, these results should not be considered indicative of future results.

The Company is a research and development company and has not generated any revenue from its product candidates. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since its inception. Through December 31, 2023, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $50.5 million. The Company’s operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible notes. The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $10.5 million. The Company expects to incur significant expenses to complete development of its product candidates. The Company may never be able to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of any of its product candidates in the United States or internationally and there can be no assurance that the Company will generate revenues or ever achieve profitability. The Company does not expect to receive significant product revenue in the near term. The Company, therefore, expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company completed its annual assessment of the useful lives of its property, plant and equipment. Due to advances in technology, the company determined it should increase the estimated useful lives of its server and network equipment from five to six years for new assets and from three to four years for used assets. This  change in accounting estimate was effective beginning January 1, 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property, plant and equipment-net in the company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate was an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of $44 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and $175 million, or $0.16 and $0.15 per basic and diluted share, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The
Company determined the Georgia JV is a VIE, and that the Company is its primary beneficiary because the Company has an obligation to
absorb losses that are potentially significant and the Company controls the majority of the activities that impact the Georgia JV’s
economic performance, specifically control of the INVOcell and lab services quality management. As a result, the Company consolidated
the Georgia JV’s results with its own. As of September 30, 2023, the Company invested $0.9 million in the Georgia JV in the form
of capital contributions as well as $0.5 million in the form of a note. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Georgia
JV recorded net losses of $0.1 million and $0.2 million respectively. Noncontrolling interest in the Georgia JV was $0.

Our credit risk is primarily with DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L, which were responsible for approximately 21.7%, 21.3% and 24.5%, respectively, or $338 million, $332 million and $382 million, respectively, of our consolidated billed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. This portion of total billed revenues of DTE Electric, Consumers Energy and IP&L include the refund of 2021 revenue accruals and deferrals and exclude any amounts for the 2023 revenue accruals and deferrals that were included in our 2023 operating revenues but will not be billed to our customers until 2025. Under DTE Electric’s and Consumers Energy’s current rate structure, DTE Electric and Consumers Energy include in their retail rates the actual cost of transmission services provided by ITCTransmission and METC, respectively, in their billings to their customers, effectively passing through to end-use consumers the total cost of transmission service. IP&L currently includes in their retail rates an allowance for transmission services provided by ITC Midwest in their billings to their customers. However, any financial difficulties experienced by DTE Electric, Consumers Energy or IP&L may affect their ability to make payments for transmission service to ITCTransmission, METC, and ITC Midwest, which could negatively impact our business. MISO, as our MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ billing agent, bills DTE Electric, Consumers Energy, IP&L and other customers on a monthly basis and collects fees for the use of the MISO Regulated Operating Subsidiaries’ transmission systems. SPP is the billing agent for ITC Great Plains and bills transmission customers for the use of ITC Great Plains transmission systems. MISO and SPP have implemented strict credit policies for its members’ customers, which include customers using our transmission systems. Specifically, MISO and SPP require a letter of credit or cash deposit equal to the credit exposure, which is determined by a credit scoring model and other factors, from any customer using a member’s transmission system.

Based on current projections, we anticipate generating cash from operations as revenue is expected to remain flat during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and decreasing working capital requirements as existing backlog is manufactured and shipped.

Our
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the three
months ended September 30, 2023, we reported revenue of $(18,791) and an accumulated deficit of $3,975,216 as of September 30, 2023.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
our ability to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet our ongoing operating expenses and ultimately in merging with another
entity with experienced management and profitable operations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in achieving these
objectives.

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”), assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company
had a net loss available for common stockholders of approximately $5,419,000. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $172,952,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $10,257,000. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, within one year from the issuance date of this filing. The Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise the required additional capital or debt financing to meet
short and long-term operating requirements. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received net cash proceeds of
approximately $1,865,000 from the sale of common shares (See Note 8), $150,000 from the sale of Series E Preferred stock and the Company

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock, although classified as issued and outstanding at September 30, 2022, is considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested. Unvested restricted stock does not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. Unvested RSUs are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.

Basic
net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the effect of Common Stock equivalents (notes convertible into Common
Stock, stock options and warrants) when, under either the treasury or if-converted method, such inclusion in the computation would be
dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the three months ended September 30, 2022, no equivalent shares of the Common
Stock were included as the Company had incurred losses during those periods and addition of such stock equivalents in the computation
would have been anti-dilutive. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not include any dilutive shares of Common
Stock equivalents in the calculation of diluted income per share, as the exercise price of the debt instruments was higher than the weighted
average price of the Common Stock of the Company as of September 30, 2023. Also, during the nine months ended September 2022, approximately

The Company recorded net losses of $11.3 million and $37.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and expects to incur losses in subsequent periods for at least the next several years. The Company is highly dependent on its ability to find additional sources of funding through either equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing agreements or a combination of any such transactions. Management believes that the Company’s existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2023 will be sufficient to fund its current operating plans through at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Adequate additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. The failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate research and development programs, or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that the Company might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $as of September 30, 2023 and total
stockholders’ deficit of $8,540,992. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,989,904 as
compared to a net loss of $1,821,013 during the same period ended September 30, 2023. These factors as well as the uncertain conditions
that the Company faces in its day-to-day operations with respect to cash flows create an uncertainty as to the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern. Management has taken action to strengthen the Company’s working capital position and generate
sufficient cash to meet its operating needs through June 30, 2024 and beyond.

Management believes that existing liquid assets as of September 30, 2023 will allow the Company to continue its operations for at least a year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. Additionally, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $62,848 and, as of September 30, 2023, had an accumulated deficit of $1,931,415. Management expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the Company will require additional capital to fund its operations and execute its business plan. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, the Company's long-term success is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise additional capital in order to fund ongoing research and development (which could occur through debt or equity issuances, sales or partnerships of non-core assets, collaborations or out-licensing of core or non-core assets, or other transactions), obtain regulatory approval of its therapeutic product candidates, successfully commercialize its therapeutic product candidates, generate revenue, meet its obligations and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings attributable to Prudential Financial are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock.

In the event of a net loss available to holders of Common Stock, undistributed earnings are not allocated to participating securities and the denominator excludes the dilutive impact of these securities as they do not share in the losses of the Company. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, as applicable, were based on 4.1 million and 4.9 million of such awards, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, as applicable, were based on 4.1 million and 5.0 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding.

Current trends in hydraulic fracturing equipment operating conditions such as larger pads, changes to job design and increased pumping hours per day have resulted in shorter useful lives for certain critical components that are included in our property and equipment assets. These recent trends necessitated a review of useful lives of our critical components like fluid ends, power ends, hydraulic fracturing units and other components in the first quarter of 2023. We determined that the estimated useful life of fluid ends is now less than one year, resulting in our determination that costs associated with the replacement of these components will no longer be capitalized, but instead recorded in inventories and amortized to cost of services over their estimated useful life. We have also shortened the estimated useful lives of power ends to two years from five years and hydraulic fracturing units to ten years from fifteen years. This change in accounting estimates was made effective January 1, 2023 and accounted for prospectively.

We recognize revenue and estimate deferred revenue based on the cost of development service incurred over the total estimated cost of development services to be provided for the development period. For revenue recognition purposes, the development period is estimated to be completed in 2026. It is possible that this period will change and is assessed at each reporting date. ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) requires that an entity include a constraint on the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is considered “constrained” if there is a potential for significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. As part of the constraint evaluation, we considered numerous factors, including a potential shift in certain responsibilities between the two parties which would result in changes to the net cost sharing payments, for which outcomes are difficult to predict as of the date of this Report. As a result, no collaboration revenue is recognized from the biosimilar program for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We will continue to evaluate the variable transaction price and related revenue recognition in each reporting period and as the above uncertainties are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized no revenue related to development services under the Viatris Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized $1.0 million and $6.2 million related to the development services under the Viatris Agreement, respectively.

The Company is in the early stages of exploration and as is common with any exploration company, it raises financing for its acquisition activities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which presumes that the Company will continue operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a loss of $1,378,425 for the period ended October 31, 2023 and has accumulated a deficit of $28,047,411.

Because the Company is included in the tax filings of other Dell entities, management has determined that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets. If Dell's ownership percentage were to fall below 80%, the Company would become ineligible for inclusion in the Dell Technologies consolidated tax group. The Company's ability to benefit from its losses and other tax attributes may be impaired resulting from the need to file its own Federal and State tax returns without the ability to offset its losses against the profits from the parent. The Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that are currently recorded based on the tax sharing agreement with Dell. Currently, net deferred tax assets are approximately $21.3 million. If the Company’s tax provision had been prepared using the separate return method, the unaudited pro forma pre-tax loss, tax expense and net loss for the nine months ended November 3, 2023 would have been $(98.5) million, $1.2 million and $(99.7) million, respectively, as a result of the recognition of a valuation allowance that would have been recorded on a significant amount of deferred tax assets as well as certain attributes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that would be lost if not utilized by the Dell consolidated group.

When Dell’s economic ownership percentage falls below 80%, the Company will become ineligible for inclusion in the Dell Technologies affiliated tax group. The Company’s ability to benefit from its losses and other tax attributes may be impaired resulting from the need to file its own Federal and State tax returns without the ability to offset its losses against the profits from the parent. Currently, net consolidated deferred tax assets are approximately $25.7 million. If the Company’s tax provision had been prepared using the separate-return method, the unaudited pro forma pre-tax loss, tax expense and net loss for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 would have been $114.5 million, $2.1 million, and $116.6 million, respectively, as a result of the recognition of a valuation allowance that would have been recorded on certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain attributes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that would be lost if not utilized by the Dell affiliated group.

---

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $11.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
the Company had negative cash flow from operating activities of $10.0 million. The Company plans to fund its cash flow needs through
current cash on hand and future debt and/or equity financings which it may obtain through one or more public or private equity offerings,
debt financings, government or other third-party funding, strategic alliances, or collaboration agreements. If the Company is unable
to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its projects and services, which could adversely affect
its future business prospects and its ability to continue as a going concern. While there are indicators of substantial doubt, the Company
believes that its current available cash on hand plus additional sources of funding, including current customer contracts as well as
the Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the Company’s issuance of Class A common stock. These alleviated
the substantial doubt, and we believe the Company will be sufficiently funded to meet its planned expenditures and to meet the Company’s
obligations for at least the one-year period following its consolidated financial statement issuance date.

The Company has recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of approximately $14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management has projected that based on our hashing rate at September 30, 2023, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations beyond the next 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. We require additional capital and if we are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP in the United States of America,
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred losses from operations of
$642,668 and $109,249, respectively. The Company had a working capital deficit of $3,524,185 as of September 30, 2023. These circumstances
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to meet short and long-term operating requirements. Management
is continuing to pursue external financing alternatives to improve the Company’s working capital position however additional financing
may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have
to cease operations.

Management
does not expect existing cash as of September 30, 2023, to be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for at least twelve months
from the issuance date of these financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumed
the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2023,
the Company has incurred losses totaling $19.4 million since inception, has not yet generated material revenue from operations, and will
require additional funds to maintain its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company intends to finance operating
costs over the next twelve months through its existing financial resources and we may also raise additional capital through equity offerings,
debt financings, collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required
to delay, reduce the scope of, or curtail, our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company changed its stock-based compensation policy for recognizing expense for graded vesting awards with only service conditions from the accelerated attribution method to the straight-line attribution method. The Company believes the straight-line attribution method for stock-based compensation expense for awards solely subject to time-based vesting conditions is the preferable accounting policy in accordance with ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, because it more accurately reflects how the award is earned over the service period and is the predominant method used in its industry. The Company applied the change retrospectively adjusting all periods presented resulting in an increase to net loss of $7.2 million and an increase to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and an increase to net loss of $0.2 million and no impact to basic and diluted loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Since inception, the Company has funded operations primarily through private and public placements of its equity, debt and warrants and through fees, cost reimbursements and payments received from its licensees. The Company commenced generating product revenues related to sales of AMZEEQ and ZILXI in January 2020 and October 2020, respectively.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $11,957 and
used cash in continuing operations of $6,619. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern within one year after the date of the financial statements being issued. As a result, the Company’s continuation
as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing until the Company can generate sufficient cash flows from
operations to meet our obligations. The Company intends to continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue its operations.
